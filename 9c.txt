title: Microsoft opening new training and development center in Vancouver, B.C. 

Microsoft is creating a new training and development center in Vancouver B.C., focused largely on Office, Bing, Skype, and MSN, and that could eventually employ 400.

The center, which the company is calling the “Microsoft Canada Excellence Centre” will open late next year in the Pacific Centre shopping mall, above a Nordstrom, in downtown Vancouver.

Microsoft will be spending $90 million a year on the center, with the bulk of that money going toward the lease and employee salaries and benefits.

Microsoft plans to hire the first of its Centre employees this summer. (There is currently office space in the building, which is being remodeled, a Microsoft spokesman said.)

The center will focus mainly on training people who will go into research and development for Microsoft’s Applications and Services Group. That group is responsible for Office, Office 365, SharePoint, Exchange, Yammer, Lync, Skype, Bing, Bing Apps, MSN and Microsoft’s Advertising platforms.

Microsoft already has a sizeable presence in Vancouver, with more than 300 employees working largely in game and entertainment development there.
