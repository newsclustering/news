title: Aaron Hernandez charged with jail scuffle, threat

Former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez has been indicted in an alleged jail assault in February and an alleged threat at the jail last November.

The Bristol County district attorney’s office said Hernandez was indicted Thursday on charges of assault and battery and threats to do bodily harm. The statement said the alleged assault occurred Feb. 25 at the Bristol County House of Correction in Dartmouth, and the alleged threat occurred there on Nov. 1.

Hernandez, who is from Bristol, Connecticut, is being held without bail at the jail after pleading not guilty to murder in the June 2013 death of Odin Lloyd, 27, of Boston. The body of Lloyd, a semi-professional football player dating the sister of Hernandez’s girlfriend, was found not far from Hernandez’s North Attleborough home.

Prosecutors said they would have no further comment on the new charges before his arraignment, which has not been scheduled. His attorney did not return a message seeking comment.

The county sheriff has said Hernandez was involved in a Feb. 25 scuffle with another inmate but neither of them required medical attention.
