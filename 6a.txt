title: Microsoft releases Internet Explorer security update

On Thursday afternoon, Microsoft announced that it released an update to address a security vulnerability affecting versions 6 through 11 of Internet Explorer for all users.

Around 1 p.m. EDT, Microsoft made the security update available for all users, including customers with Windows XP. Microsoft no longer supports Windows XP and has been strongly encouraging customers to migrate to a newer operating system such as Windows 7 or 8.1.

Adrienne Hall, general manager of Microsoft Trustworthy Computing, said in a statement that the company decided to fix the problem quickly for all customers, saying it takes the security of its products "incredibly seriously."

The IE bug, as it was commonly referred to, allowed attackers to take complete control of a computer. Microsoft reported the problem Saturday, saying it was aware of "limited, targeted attacks" and that the vulnerability affected Internet Explorer versions 6 through 11.

A division of the Department of Homeland Security also suggested downloading the workarounds recommended by Microsoft or using another browser until an update became available.
The company said users with automatic updates enabled will not need to take any action.
