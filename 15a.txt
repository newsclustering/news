title: Marco Rubio endorses Cory Gardner for Senate in Colorado

Sen. Marco Rubio, a potential 2016 presidential contender, is stepping up his efforts to put Republicans in power in the  U.S. Senate.

Rubio and his Reclaim America PAC on Friday endorsed Rep. Cory Gardner, who is trying to defeat Democratic Sen. Mark Udall in Colorado. Gardner’s late entry in the Colorado race put the state in play for Republicans, who need a net gain of six seats to take control of the Senate.

“Always an advocate for limited government and lower taxes, Cory is never one to shy away from tough choices,” reads the message on the PAC’s website urging Rubio’s supporters to donate.

Gardner joins Rep. Tom Cotton in Arkansas on Reclaim America PAC’s endorsement list. Cotton is challenging Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor. As USA TODAY’s Fredreka Schouten noted, Rubio and other potential presidential candidates are using their leadership PACs to underwrite consulting, travel and other political expenses ahead of 2016.

Rubio’s endorsement of Gardner was first reported by CNN.
