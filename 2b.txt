title: Mitt Romney endorses Monica Wehby in GOP primary

Monica Wehby has announced her second endorsement this week from a well known GOP figure: Mitt Romney.

The former candidate for U.S. president is backing the Portland neurosurgeon in her primary race to be the Republican to challenge incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley this November.

"Dr. Wehby is the kind of leader Oregon needs — someone who has strong experience outside of government, who can bring trust and accountability back to Washington," Romney said in a statement. "Dr. Wehby is putting forward a positive and conservative vision for her campaign that will make Oregonians proud."

Romney's endorsement isn't surprising given that Wehby's campaign manager Charlie Pearce worked on Romney's 2008 and 2012 presidential bids.

Newt Gingrich threw his support behind Wehby Tuesday.

In addition to attracting national endorsements, Wehby's also attracting significantly more money than her fellow primary opponents.

Wehby raked in nearly $600,000 during the first quarter, bringing her war chest to more than $1 million.

Rep. Jason Conger, R-Bend, brought in slightly less than $64,000 during the same time period.

The winner of the Republican primary will need deep pockets.

Republican and Democratic polls have shown Merkley with a lead on his opponents, and he raised more than $1 million in the first three months of 2014.

Wehby's campaign hopes her big name endorsements signal to Oregon primary voters that she's the best choice.

"When we began this journey not a lot of people thought Oregon would be competitive this November," Wehby said in a statement. "With Governor Romney's endorsement, Republicans all over the country will now know that Oregon's U.S. Senate seat is in play."
