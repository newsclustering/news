title: Microsoft Acquires GreenButton To Deliver Big Compute

The news is that Microsoft is buying high performance computing vendor GreenButton. The back story is even more interesting involving Kiwis, Hobbits and some very cool live demos.

If I had to draw a venn diagram with cloud in one circle and my home of New Zealand in the other, the overlap would be very small indeed. Back when I stared writing about this stuff a decade or so ago, clouds, as far as my compatriots were concerned, were those white fluffy things in the sky.

So when I hear of a vendor doing interesting cloud stuff from New Zealand, I get interested. When that vendor has an awesome inception story that involved Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings, that gets my attention even more. GreenButton is that vendor. Founded several years ago by some of the team that built the high performance computing infrastructure for Jackson’s movies, GreenButton was on a quest to bring high performance computing to the world, powered by the cloud. Initially focused (not surprisingly given their genesis) on powering rendering jobs from the cloud, GreenButton dabbled in a few different high performance areas – and scored customers such as Pixar, NASA and Boeing BA -0.43%. I was excited by what GreenButton was doing, as I wrote in a post a few years ago:

    Dave Fellowes [GreenButton's lead architect] did a live demo and rendered 40 seconds or so of video, using Greenbutton to move the entire rendering workload to a collection of virtual machines sitting in an Azure data center. Despite the data travelling tens of thousands of miles on its roundtrip journey for processing, a rendering job that would have taken hours on a high performance on-premise machine, took a matter of minutes and was run through a commodity laptop connected with marginal WiFi in the backroom of a pub.
It seems that Microsoft MSFT -0.99% was even more excited, and saw the value that high performance computing could bring to Azure. This morning Microsoft is announcing that it has acquired GreenButton and sees it as key to “strengthening the Azure Big Compute muscle”. Microsoft is integrating the GreenButton platform into Azure and will, one assumes, offer the combined product to customers with workloads requiring larger than normal scale. This deal has been a long time coming, several years ago, in an interview with AllThingsDigital, Doug Hauger, the general manager of Azure for Microsoft at the time said that;

    We’re also seeing companies using the high performance computing workload. One example is a company called Greenbutton, which has done a high performance scheduling and billing system on Azure. Another is Pixar, which has an application called RenderMan, which does rendering. Most large animation houses have their own clusters they do this rendering on. Pixar wanted to open up a market for smaller animation houses, little Pixars if you will. They’re working with Greenbutton to embed their technology into RenderMan. They can farm their rendering out to Azure and be billed on a usage basis. That’s a case where you have a large company and a smaller one working together and leveraging the power of the cloud to open up a whole new marketplace where they can be competitive. We call it the democratization of IT.

Microsoft actually partnered with GreenButton to the tune of $1M back in 2011 – not as an investor but in a mutually beneficial commercial arrangement. Since then, and despite GreenButton dabbling with the OpenStack ecosystem, the company’s roots, the fact Redmond was a partner, and market dynamics suggested Microsoft would always be the best home for the company.

Neither party is disclosing the commercial terms of the deal, but Microsoft were at pains to say that the GreenButton team would transfer, en masse, to within the azure team and that the New Zealand operations of the company would remain and be expanded.

Time will tell what this means for GreenButton’s non-Azure customers, but for Microsoft it’s an interesting and logical deal. While many cloud vendors are looking at the developer opportunity, there is plenty of scope to deliver interesting services to customers with high computing requirements – Azure plus GreenButton makes that all the more possible.
