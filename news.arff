10a.txt,'title: NYC strikes deal with teachers union to end 5-year dispute\r\n\r\nNew York City and its largest teachers union struck a deal on a new contract Thursday, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced, ending a nearly five-year labor dispute and potentially setting a template for negotiations with the city\'s other unions.\r\n\r\nTeachers will receive back pay equivalent of nearly 8 percent of their salaries and a series of additional small raises through 2018, according to the nine-year contract, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press in advance of the deal announcement.\r\n\r\nThe contract, which will expire after de Blasio runs for re-election, also will fund merit pay for teachers and provides the city $1 billion in health care savings over the length of the deal, an important point among city negotiators wary of the budgetary strain caused by rising health care costs across the municipal labor force. De Blasio noted that the agreement is being funded within the city\'s current budget framework and called it a victory for taxpayers.\r\n\r\n\"This agreement will be a gateway to great progress in our school system,\" he added at a news conference.\r\n\r\nThe deal is the first labor agreement struck by de Blasio, a Democrat who took office in January, and it could impact negotiations with the other nearly 150 city labor unions, all of whom have been working with expired contracts. The United Federation of Teachers, one of the most powerful unions in the city, represents 100,000 teachers and other school employees who have been working on an expired contract since 2009. New York\'s public school system serves 1.1 million students, by far the largest in the country.\r\n\r\n\"We were creative, we were smart, we were respectful, and teachers now have a fair deal going forward,\" UFT President Michael Mulgrew said. The new deal will not become official until it is voted on by the union\'s members.\r\n\r\nThe UFT, which long pushed for retroactive raises, will receive 4 percent raises for 2009 and 2010, the same figure provided to other unions during that time by de Blasio\'s predecessor, Michael Bloomberg. The money will start being paid in 2015 and is spread over the next several years.\r\n\r\nTeachers will also receive a one-time $1,000 ratification payment, according to the contract. The teachers will not receive back pay for 2011 and 2012.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, teachers will receive a series of incremental annual raises; 1 percent from 2013 to 2015, then 1.5 percent in 2016, 2.5 percent in 2017 and 3 percent in 2018. The deal expires in October 2018, nearly a year after de Blasio faces voters again.\r\n\r\nRetroactive raises have long been at the center of the contract negotiations, which became a significant issue during the mayoral campaign last year.\r\n\r\nBloomberg, a Republican turned independent, long said the city could not afford retroactive raises for all unions, which could total up to $8 billion. Many of the unions ended negotiations in recent years preferring to wait for a new mayor who may have warmer relations with unions; as a result, all of their contracts had expired by the time Bloomberg left office.\r\n\r\nDe Blasio is a close ally of unions but has also expressed wariness about the city\'s ability to afford retroactive raises for all unions. Other municipal labor leaders are anxiously eyeing the UFT negotiations believing it could establish baselines for future negotiations.\r\n\r\nCity workers do not contribute to their health care costs, which will not change in the new deal. The $1 billion in health care savings achieved by the end of this contract will occur by other means, including centralized drug purchases and auditing health benefits to remove individuals not entitled to services.\r\n\r\nIn a memo about the UFT deal obtained by The Associated Press, the de Blasio administration suggests that the health care cost-control measures would save a total of $3.4 billion by 2018 if applied to all of the city\'s unions.\r\n\r\nThe teachers deal also address several hotly debated education issues. It will provide an additional $5,000 annual bonus for experienced teachers to stay in schools in underserved neighborhoods, and provides a new bonus structure — which features payments ranging from $7,000 to $20,000 a year — for highly rated teachers. The teacher evaluation system will also be overhauled, simplifying it from 22 criteria to eight.\r\n\r\nThe contract also will change the guidelines of the ongoing debate over the 1,000 teachers who are still being paid even though their jobs have been eliminated; if the new deal is approved, dismissal proceedings will begin against poor-performing teachers who are twice removed from classrooms by principals.\r\n\r\nIt also toughens the standards against teachers behaving inappropriately against students, now making inappropriate texting, particularly of a sexual nature, an offense that could warrant firing. The deal also will increase the number of parent-teacher conferences and, in 200 schools, allow principals to make sweeping changes, including lengthening both the school day and school year.\r\n'

10c.txt,'title: NYC, Teachers Union Announce Preliminary 9-Year Contract Deal\r\n\r\nMayor Bill de Blasio and the city teachers union have finalized details on a preliminary contract agreement that would give classroom educators raises for the first time in nearly five years and buy labor peace until 2018, after the next mayoral election.\r\n\r\nTeachers will receive back pay equivalent of nearly 8 percent of their salaries and a series of additional small raises through 2018, according to the nine-year contract.\r\n\r\nIn addition to pay hikes, the new contract will allow the city to suspend union rules and use the charter school model at 200 public schools, CBS 2\'s Marcia Kramer reported.\r\n\r\nDuring his brief term in office, de Blasio had an epic clash with charter school operators — one that was so intense that Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the Legislature usurped some of the city’s authority over charters.\r\n\r\nNow, it seems, the success of private charter schools is something the city wants to emulate.\r\n\r\nThe new pact with the 100,000-member United Federation of Teachers will allow the city to suspend union rules at 10 percent of public schools to, in effect, create its own charters, which would allow for the changing of the length of the school year, the timing of the school day and even the curriculum, Kramer reported.\r\n\r\nThe mayor and the head of the UFT announced the tentative deal at a press conference Thursday afternoon.\r\n\r\n“We have reached a landmark agreement for our schoolteachers but, first and foremost, a landmark agreement for our children and families,” de Blasio said.\r\n\r\nThe agreement is fully funded within the city’s current budget and will not require tax increases to cover the costs, according to the city. The contract will also fund merit pay for teachers.\r\n\r\nThe deal signifies Mayor de Blasio’s first major successful union contract negotiation since taking office.\r\n\r\n“This is an extraordinary day,” mayor said. “An extraordinary day for our teachers, an extraordinary day for our children, an extraordinary day for our parents and a day that will literally frame the future of education in New York City for the better.”\r\n\r\nThe nine-year agreement brings a number of groundbreaking reforms to improve public education for every student, while also making changes to provide more than $1 billion in health care cost savings over the next four years, according to the mayor’s office. The deal will also support excellence in teaching, officials announced.\r\n\r\n“New York City is for the first time in a long time truly in the educational reform mode and I can’t thank the mayor enough for allowing this,” UFT President Michael Mulgrew said Thursday. “Teachers now have a fair deal moving forward.”\r\n\r\n“What’s not possible is possible,” City Schools Chancellor Carmen Farina added.\r\n\r\nNew York’s public school system serves 1.1 million students, by far the largest in the country.\r\n\r\nGreat care was taken with this contract since it is expected to set the pattern for the rest of the city’s work force. De Blasio has 152 labor contracts to settle.\r\n\r\nThe UFT, which long pushed for retroactive raises, will receive 4 percent raises for 2009 and 2010, the same figure provided to other unions during that time by de Blasio’s predecessor, Michael Bloomberg.

10d.txt,'title: NYC, teachers union reach new contract\r\n\r\n New York City and the union that represents teachers in the nation\'s largest public school district reached an agreement on hammering out a new 9-year contract on Thursday.\r\n\r\nThe new multiyear deal could set a template for negotiations with more than 150 other unions working on expired contracts.\r\n\r\nThe 9-year agreement will implement a number of groundbreaking reforms that the city says will make schools laboratories of innovation and improve public education for every student, while also making important changes that will provide more than $1 billion in health care cost savings over the next four years.\r\n\r\n\"Working together with our dedicated teachers - instead of being locked in rancorous debate - we have found common ground today that moves us closer to those critical objectives,\" said Mayor Bill de Blasio. \"Everyone needs to play a positive role in our children\'s future, and this agreement deepens parental engagement, recognizes quality teachers, and ensures our students will benefit from a new era of educational reforms that will improve learning and performance in the classroom.\"\r\n\r\nThe United Federation of Teachers represents 100,000 teachers and other school employees who have been working on an expired contract since 2009. Union leaders have long pushed for substantial retroactive raises of up to $3.4 billion.\r\n\r\nUnder the proposed agreement, teachers would receive similar raises to those that had been granted by the previous administration to much of the municipal workforce of 4 percent each for 2009 and 2010. The raises will be restructured and provided to teachers in increments from 2015 to 2020. The agreement includes a one-time $1,000 ratification payment. Wage increases constituting a new pattern for the following years are on the schedule below:\r\n\r\nMay 2013: 1\%\r\nMay 2014: 1\%\r\nMay 2015: 1\%\r\nMay 2016: 1.5\%\r\nMay 2017: 2.5\%\r\nMay 2018: 3\%\r\n\r\nThe deal ends years of hostility between the teachers union and City Hall. De Blasio\'s predecessor, Michael Bloomberg, declined to grant any retroactive raises and often engaged in verbal clashes with the union\'s president, Michael Mulgrew.\r\n\r\n\"Mayor de Blasio said we could make the city better if we all worked together in a spirit of respect and cooperation. This agreement - which works for students, parents, teachers and the city - is proof that with leadership like his, we can do it,\" Mulgrew said.\r\n\r\nBloomberg, a Republican turned independent, long said the city could not afford the retroactive raises, which could total up to $8 billion. Many of the unions ended negotiations in recent years preferring to wait for a new mayor who may have warmer relations with unions; as a result, all of the city\'s unions\' contracts had expired by the time Bloomberg left office.\r\n\r\nDe Blasio, a Democrat who took office in January, is a close ally of unions but has also expressed wariness about the city\'s ability to afford retroactive raises for all unions.

10e.txt,'title: Teacher Contract Offers City a Map for Other Labor Deals \r\n\r\nMayor Bill de Blasio, confronting the unsettled labor agreements that have loomed over his first months in office, announced a deal on Thursday with New York City’s largest teachers’ union that would raise wages by 18 percent over nine years in exchange for a $1.3 billion reduction in health care costs.\r\n\r\nThe agreement, which includes $3.4 billion in back pay and must be ratified by the union’s 100,000 members, is a milestone moment for Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat with longstanding ties to the city’s labor movement, and city officials hope it will set a template for dozens of other outstanding contracts with the municipal work force.\r\n\r\nIt also amounted to a stark break from the tone set by the mayor’s predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, who had urged pay freezes and other stringent measures in an era when many cities are cutting back on wages and benefits for public employees.\r\n\r\nUnderscoring the change at City Hall, Mr. de Blasio unveiled the plan while standing side-by-side at a news conference with the union’s president, Michael Mulgrew, a close ally who had been a bête noire of Mr. Bloomberg’s.\r\n\r\n“This is a mayor who actually respects the work force,” Mr. Mulgrew, who leads the United Federation of Teachers, said as Mr. de Blasio beamed beside him. At one point, the two warmly embraced.\r\n\r\nMr. de Blasio, a liberal whose mayoralty is viewed as a test case for the national left, hailed the deal as “a great day for our educators” and “a great victory for the taxpayers,” saying the agreement would provide annual raises and promote teacher retention while staying within the contours of the city’s budget.\r\n\r\nOfficials at the teachers’ union also agreed to an easing of classroom rules that have frustrated public school officials. For instance, it will be easier for the city to fire teachers who are considered poor performers, or who have been accused of sexual misconduct.\r\n\r\nIt was unclear on Thursday exactly how the union would reduce its health care costs. City and labor officials declined to give details, except to pledge that the reductions would rely on a piecemeal approach that did not involve raising workers’ premiums.\r\n\r\nMartin Scheinman, a mediator who was lavishly praised by Mr. de Blasio for bringing the two sides to terms, would be empowered to require specific savings measures if the union does not produce the $1.3 billion in cuts, according to an official involved in the negotiations who insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations.\r\n\r\nA mayor’s first major labor deal often sets a pattern for the rest, and the de Blasio administration is hopeful that the framework of the deal can extend to the 151 other municipal bargaining units that must still negotiate contracts with the city that have expired.\r\n\r\nThe teachers’ union has been without a contract for four and a half years, after complaining viscerally about the Bloomberg administration’s approach to negotiations. The retroactive pay granted in the deal is the same pair of 4 percent raises that most other municipal unions received in 2009 and 2010.\r\n\r\nRaises of an additional 10 percent spread over the remaining seven years in the new agreement would provide a pattern for deals with the other municipal unions, officials said.\r\n\r\nIf the other unions agree to similar health care savings, the spending cuts realized would total $3.4 billion, officials said — the same amount as the teachers’ union’s back pay.\r\n\r\nBut there were signs on Thursday that it could be a tough sell. Officials from unions representing uniformed workers expressed concern that the teachers’ deal did not suit their needs.\r\n\r\n“There is no ‘one contract fits all,’ ” said a spokesman for Patrick J. Lynch, president of the police officers’ union, the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association. Different unions, the spokesman, Albert W. O’Leary, said, “have different and specific needs for their members.”\r\n\r\nOfficials and labor leaders said that members of the Municipal Labor Committee, a consortium of public-employee groups, were hesitant to accept the reductions in health care costs agreed to by the teachers.\r\n\r\nMr. Mulgrew, asked on Thursday about the possible objections of his peers in other unions, issued a tart reply.\r\n\r\n“Talk to them in a couple of days, after I talk to them,” Mr. Mulgrew said with a grin. “How’s that?”\r\n\r\nThe nine-year agreement was significantly longer than most recent municipal contracts in New York, and a way, city officials said, to spread the fiscal impact of the wage increases and retroactive payments across many years’ worth of budgets.\r\n\r\nYet aides to Mr. de Blasio were unable on Thursday, despite repeated entreaties from reporters, to provide the total net cost of the contract.\r\n\r\nFiscal watchdog groups offered approval, with some caveats, for the architecture of the plan, saying it was preferable to extend the wage payments over time.\r\n\r\nBut some were skeptical about the health care component of the agreement, saying they wanted to see more evidence that the union could achieve the promised level of savings.\r\n\r\n“The wage part of it is relatively reasonable,” said Carol Kellermann, president of the Citizens Budget Commission. “The prospective wages are not unduly high, and seem to be respectful of the city’s fiscal health.”\r\n\r\nStill, Ms. Kellerman added that, at the moment, the estimates for health care savings appeared “not quantifiable, stable or predictable.”\r\n\r\nMr. de Blasio, for his part, said he believed the agreement would be a boon to the city’s schoolchildren, saying that the changes in some work rules would allow educators to alter the length of the school year, change curriculums and increase the number of parent-teacher conferences each year.\r\n\r\nAnd the mayor took pains to signal that he wanted the city’s attitude toward its teachers, and its broader public work force, to be one of cooperation and “understanding” moving forward.\r\n\r\nStill, his next labor headache may be around the corner. Minutes before the mayor’s announcement, officials at the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association said that talks with City Hall had fallen apart, declaring the city’s offer of three years without raises as “simply unacceptable.”\r\n\r\nThe state’s Public Employment Relations Board granted the union an impasse in its talks with the de Blasio administration, allowing its president, Mr. Lynch, to argue before a mediator that the police should receive a more generous deal than the pattern forged with the teachers’ union would suggest.\r\n'
11a.txt,'title: Benghazi -- government cover-up or right-wing conspiracy theory?\r\n\r\nRepublicans call it a government cover-up similar to what forced Richard Nixon to resign. Democrats call it a right-wing conspiracy theory.\r\n\r\nThe fallout from the September 11, 2012, terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans continues more than 19 months later, with further details this week that raised questions about how the Obama administration responded to the violence less than two months before the President\'s re-election.\r\n\r\nFew issues reveal the hyper-partisan politics of Washington more than the ongoing debate over an issue now known simply as Benghazi.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa announced that he subpoenaed Secretary of State John Kerry to testify at a May 21 hearing, alleging that the State Department failed to comply with an earlier subpoena for documents. Later, House Speaker John Boehner announced a special congressional committee led by a Republican colleague would investigate the matter.\r\n\r\nA day earlier, Issa said the transgression was \"in violation of any reasonable transparency or historic precedent at least since Richard Milhous Nixon.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lead: Documents reinforce White House push about video\r\n\r\nAt the White House, spokesman Jay Carney shot back that Republicans continued trying to reap political benefit with what he called conspiracy theories about a Benghazi cover-up.\r\n\r\n\"What we have seen since hours after the attack, beginning with a statement by the Republican nominee for president, is an attempt by Republicans to politicize a tragedy, and that continues today,\" Carney told reporters Thursday, adding that \"what hasn\'t changed has been the effort by Republicans to ... claim a conspiracy when they haven\'t been able to find one.\"\r\n\r\nHere are some answers to questions about the latest twists in the story:\r\n\r\nWhat happened in Benghazi?\r\n\r\nIn September of 2012, a demeaning video made in the United States about the Prophet Mohammed got posted on YouTube and sparked protests at U.S. embassies in the Muslim world.\r\n\r\nOn September 11, the anniversary of the 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, an assault occurred at a U.S. compound in Benghazi that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.\r\n\r\nThe Obama administration initially blamed the Benghazi attack on a protest against the video that escalated into a full-blown tactical assault. As details emerged in ensuing days, it became clear that an al Qaeda-affiliated group took part in what was a coordinated terrorist attack instead of a spontaneous demonstration.\r\n\r\nThen Secretary of State Hillary Clinton created a special panel called an Accountability Review Board to investigate what happened. The group led by former Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen and retired U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering criticized aspects of diplomatic security and made 29 recommendations, all of which were accepted by the State Department.\r\n\r\nWhy all the controversy?\r\n\r\nComing less than two months before the presidential election, the Benghazi attack quickly became a political flashpoint.\r\n\r\nPresident Barack Obama had campaigned heavily on his decision to approve the mission that killed Osama bin Laden and boasted of putting the al Qaeda leader\'s organization \"on the run.\"\r\n\r\nOn September 16, five days after the Benghazi attack, then U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice went on Sunday talk shows and said the assault grew out of a protest against the controversial video.\r\n\r\nRepublicans immediately challenged the administration\'s version of what happened, calling it an attempt by the Obama administration to hide a major security breakdown that signaled the broader failed policy in the region.\r\n\r\nObama won re-election in November, but Republicans have mounted congressional investigations into what happened in Benghazi and why Rice gave an incorrect explanation to the American people.\r\n\r\nWhat is the Benghazi email everyone is talking about?\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, a conservative group called Judicial Watch made public State Department documents it received in response to a Freedom of Information Act request.\r\n\r\nOne of the documents was a previously undisclosed email on September 14, 2012, from Ben Rhodes, a national security official specializing in communications, that listed talking points for Rice about the protests that had erupted at U.S. embassies and compounds in the Muslim world.\r\n\r\nAmong the goals listed in the Rhodes email was to \"underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure of policy.\"\r\n\r\nRepublicans contend the email proves White House manipulation of the messaging for political purposes in the immediate aftermath of Benghazi, despite the administration\'s contention that Rice relied on talking points provided by the CIA for the sake of uniformity of messaging.\r\n\r\n\"This is all about an effort to convince the American people that the president of the United States had everything under control,\" GOP Sen. John McCain said Thursday.\r\n\r\nBoehner and other Republicans questioned why the Rhodes email wasn\'t included in documents that the State Department provided to Congress under the earlier subpoena.\r\n\r\nIn announcing the new subpoena of Kerry on Friday, Issa cited what he called \"a disturbing disregard for the (State) Department\'s legal obligations to Congress.\"\r\n\r\nCarney argued that the Rhodes email referred to the broader topic of protests throughout the Muslim world, rather than the specific Benghazi attack.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a State Department spokeswoman took issue with Issa\'s latest subpoena, telling reporters it was a political stunt.\r\n\r\nNoting Kerry was scheduled to be in Mexico on the date of the hearing in the subpoena, Marie Harf said Issa\'s committee \"would have known if they reached out to us instead of issuing a subpoena.\"\r\n\r\nIs this new or just more of what we already knew?\r\n\r\nThe existence of the Rhodes email is new, and that provides Republicans with a fresh front in their attacks on the administration over Benghazi.\r\n\r\nLabeling the situation a \"defiance of the House\'s subpoena power,\" Boehner called it \"the most flagrant example yet of the administration\'s contempt for the American people\'s right to know the truth about what happened when four Americans died in a fiery terrorist attack.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, the messaging contained in the Rhodes email is the same as included in previously released documents, such as the CIA talking points that Rice relied on.\r\n\r\nCarney noted Thursday that the only reference in the Rhodes email to Benghazi -- denying that there was actionable intelligence ahead of time of an imminent assault -- was lifted from the CIA talking points.\r\n\r\nI thought the government promised to release all information?\r\n\r\nThe Obama administration previously pledged to release all pertinent information on Benghazi sought by Congress. Carney noted Thursday that it turned over 25,000 pages of documents and that various officials testified at a series of hearings by various congressional committees investigating the matter.\r\n\r\nAsked why the Rhodes email obtained by Judicial Watch hadn\'t been turned over previously, Carney said it came under a FOIA request that differed from the congressional subpoenas from Issa\'s committee.\r\n\r\nUnderlying Carney\'s explanation was that the Rhodes email referred to the broader issue of protests rather than the specific Benghazi attack, which was the focus of the subpoenas. The talking points supplied by Rhodes were intended to prepare Rice for possible questions in her talk show appearances, he said, calling the document a normal duty of a communications officer in any government.\r\n\r\nRepublicans questioned that explanation, noting the Benghazi attack would clearly be the dominant topic that Rice would face and arguing the administration clearly knew that.\r\n\r\nWhat\'s the upshot of all this?\r\n\r\nFor Republicans, the issue resonates with their conservative base, especially the accusation that the Obama administration failed to provide proper security for American diplomats and was unable to send military assets to respond to the Benghazi attack.\r\n\r\nAt a hearing Thursday by Issa\'s committee, a retired Air Force general on duty at U.S. Africa Command that night complained that the military should have tried to save the Benghazi victims even if the effort would have been futile.\r\n\r\nWhen Republican Rep. James Lankford asked Brig. Gen. Robert Lovell \"did we have their back that night,\" Lovell responded: \"Obviously not, sir.\"\r\n\r\nBoehner\'s announcement of a special congressional panel to further investigate Benghazi fulfilled a request by many GOP colleagues eager to frame the final years of Obama\'s presidency on their terms.\r\n\r\nUntil now, Boehner had resisted calls to establish such a committee, pointing to the four House panels already investigating the matter.\r\n\r\nDemocrats wanting to get past the issue portray Republicans as driven by partisan desire to hurt Obama. Carney referred repeatedly Thursday to what he described as GOP conspiracy theories regarding Benghazi that have failed to pan out.\r\n\r\n\"Everything that this committee would look at has already been looked at ad nauseam by multiple committees,\" Harf noted Friday. \"What\'s the point?\"\r\n\r\nIs there more than meets the eye?\r\n\r\nIn Washington, always.\r\n\r\nThe issue gives Republicans perhaps their lone line of attack against Hillary Clinton, the overwhelming favorite for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 if she decides to run.\r\n\r\nA new poll Thursday showed Clinton\'s strong standing. The Quinnipiac University survey from Florida had Clinton topping former two-term Gov. Jeb Bush, the leading potential Republican contender in the nation\'s most populous swing state.\r\n\r\nBecause Clinton was secretary of state when the Benghazi attack occurred, Republicans have sought to depict her as inattentive to security needs of diplomatic staff.\r\n\r\nAt Thursday\'s House Oversight Committee hearing, Lovell described how he and others desperately considered possible deployment of a rapid-force team to Benghazi, but needed a State Department request that never came.\r\n\r\n\"Were they doing what they were trained to do or were they sitting around and waiting for the State Department and Hillary Clinton to call them up and say do something?\" GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah asked him.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Howard \"Buck\" McKeon of California, issued a statement later Thursday that said his panel investigated the matter and found \"no evidence that Department of State officials delayed the decision to deploy what few resources (the military) had available to respond.\"\r\n\r\nDemocrats face what analysts expect will be a difficult mid-term election in November, with little chance of winning back the House from Republicans and facing the possibility of losing their majority in the Senate.\r\n\r\nBoehner\'s call for yet another congressional committee to investigate could provide Democrats with a rallying point to motivate voters to prevent Republicans from retaking the Senate in November and gaining full control of Congress.\r\n'
11b.txt,'title: Release of White House email stirs up a new controversy over Benghazi\r\n\r\nA newly released email has again put President Obama and his senior aides on the defensive for their response to the 2012 attack that killed four Americans at the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya.\r\n\r\nBen Rhodes, Obama’s deputy national security advisor, wrote the email to help prepare Susan Rice, then U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, for a round of interviews on Sunday TV talk shows to discuss the Benghazi attack and a wave of anti-American protests around the globe that week.\r\n\r\nHe urged Rice “to underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure of policy.”\r\n\r\nRepublicans and administration critics long have accused the White House and Rice, now the president’s national security advisor, of falsely blaming the Benghazi attack on an anti-Islamic video to shield the president’s image in an election year.\r\n\r\nSeveral Republicans described the latest email as a “smoking gun” that showed the White House sought to cover up a lethal terrorist attack for partisan gain.\r\n\r\nThe crude video, made in the U.S., sparked protests and riots in more than 35 cities in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia. But the CIA and other investigations concluded that Libyan extremist groups organized and carried out the Benghazi attack that killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher J. Stevens.\r\n\r\nRhodes’ email was dated Sept. 14, 2012, three days after the Benghazi attack. It was obtained by the conservative group Judicial Watch through a Freedom of Information Act request to the State Department. The White House has previously released email correspondence detailing how “talking points” vetted by the CIA had shaped Rice’s comments.\r\n\r\nWhite House spokesman Jay Carney said Thursday that the email was not previously released because it did not deal specifically with Benghazi, but with the broader unrest. He said Rice’s comments on the TV shows were based on the intelligence available at the time, not on political considerations.\r\n\r\n“It was based on currently available information,” Carney said. “And as you can imagine, in those days after an attack, in a regional city in a far-away country, that information was not complete, which is what we said repeatedly.”\r\n\r\nSen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said Thursday that Carney’s assertion that the email was not about Benghazi was a “total departure from reality.”\r\n\r\nMcCain also challenged Carney’s statement that the guidance given to Rice was based on the best available intelligence.\r\n\r\nRhodes “had no information that there was a spontaneous demonstration sparked by a video. That was manufactured somewhere,” McCain said on the Senate floor. “The American people need to know where that came from.... We need to know who gave her those talking points because they are patently false.”\r\n\r\nRhodes’ email to Rice was circulated to a large group of White House aides, including Carney. It included talking points on how the Obama administration was handling the violence and tried to anticipate reporters’ questions.\r\n\r\nOne of those questions was whether there was truth to a report that the Obama administration had received and ignored intelligence about a possible attack.\r\n\r\n“That story is absolutely wrong,” Rhodes wrote. “We are not aware of any actionable intelligence indicating that an attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi was planned or imminent. We also see indications that this action was related to the video that has sparked protests in other countries.”\r\n\r\nIn her appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Sunday, Rice described the Benghazi attack as “initially a spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired hours before in Cairo … prompted by the video.”\r\n\r\n'
11c.txt,'title: Email reignites Benghazi controversy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe deadly 2012 Benghazi attack has resurfaced as a political embarrassment for the White House, with a so-called smoking gun email that documents administration efforts to blame the terrorist attack on an anti-Muslim video — forcing President Obama’s spokesman Jay Carney on the defensive for two days running.\r\n\r\n“It’s disturbing, and perhaps criminal, that these documents were kept from the public,” House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) said yesterday. “It comes in a week in which the American people have learned that you cannot believe what the White House says … and you cannot believe what the president says.”\r\n\r\nCarney insisted the email released Tuesday by Washington-based Judicial Watch referred to unrest across the region.\r\n\r\n“The email and the talking points were not about Benghazi,” Carney said. “They were about the general situation in the Muslim world.”\r\n\r\nSean Dunagan of Judicial Watch called that claim “ludicrous,” telling Boston Herald Radio yesterday the email to former U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice was written three days after the attacks and two days before Rice made her rounds on Sunday morning talk shows to discuss Benghazi.\r\n\r\nThe email, with the subject line “RE: PREP CALL with Susan, Saturday at 4:00 pm ET,” states as a “goal” to “underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure or policy.”\r\n\r\n“There is no way that would not have been the White House’s focus,” Dunagan said about Benghazi. “They can make that claim, but personally, looking at the timeline, I don’t find that credible.\r\n\r\n“It’s reasonable to assume that one of the initial avenues investigated might have been that this was similar to what was happening in other countries, but by the 14th, that was known not to be true,” said Dunagan.\r\n\r\nThe email, released to Judicial Watch under the Freedom of Information Act, was not among emails the White House released last year as it tried to clear itself. Dunagan noted that the email’s author, deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes, was previously an Obama campaign speech writer.\r\n'
11d.txt,'title: Fox News’s Bill O’Reilly credits USA Today for Benghazi coverage, slams rest of media\r\n\r\n“Congratulations to USA Today,” thundered Fox news host Bill O’Reilly on last night’s version of “The O’Reilly Factor.”\r\n\r\nWhat had the newspaper done to deserve such credit? It had placed the latest Benghazi, Libya, story on its front page. And in some precincts, especially Fox News, that Benghazi story is a huge one: Via e-mails secured by Judicial Watch under a State Department Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, we learn that White House official Ben Rhodes cited the following as a “goal” for the administration in explaining the Benghazi attack: “to underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure of policy.”\r\n\r\nThat e-mail went out on Sept. 14; two days later, then-U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice went on the Sunday talk shows to claim that the Benghazi attacks, which claimed the lives of four U.S. personnel, were inspired by protests over an anti-Islamic video. Republicans have charged that Rice’s statements were all politics, an attempt to explain away a terrorist attack in the middle of an election in which President Obama was touting his anti-terrorism credentials.\r\n\r\nThe White House has responded to this critique consistently from the day it surfaced: The information that Rice dispensed at the Sunday shows reflected the government’s intelligence assessment at the time — even though “multiple streams of intelligence” indicated otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn his riff on the issue, O’Reilly slights The  Post for placing this story on Page A17. He’s probably not pleased with this conclusion in that story, either: “Ultimately, the new e-mails do little more than buttress what has been known for a year about the immediate communication among the Obama team as it rushed to cobble together talking points from the information it had to feed to Rice, who was only asked late in the day Friday to be the White House mouthpiece.” Eli Lake of the Daily Beast reached this conclusion: “The Rhodes email offers the clearest evidence to date that the talking points read by Susan Rice two days later on Sunday talk shows were indeed directed by the White House.”\r\n\r\nThe New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Boston Globe and the Los Angeles Times, noted O’Reilly, made “no mention” of the Rhodes thing in their Wednesday editions. “None,” ripped the host, who also criticized the network news shows and MSNBC for not going with it. “Proof that the American press is dishonest.”\r\n\r\nOverheated words on Benghazi are standard on Fox News. This story needn’t have preoccupied the front pages of all U.S. dailies. Yet O’Reilly is hitting on something here. Congress and news organizations have been pursuing all available documents regarding Benghazi for a long time now. This Daily Beast piece notes that the Judicial Watch documents didn’t get released to the House Government Oversight committee until two weeks ago, “despite requests from the committee for such material that date back to August 2013.”\r\n\r\nWhy did it take so long for the contents of this particular e-mail to surface?\r\n\r\nThat question alone is enough to fill some news coverage. Yesterday White House Press Secretary Jay Carney fielded an inquiry about the tardiness of the Rhodes e-mail and responded like this:\r\n\r\n    MR. CARNEY: That’s an excellent question. Because all of the documents — the thousands and thousands of pages of documents, including e-mails around the creation of the Benghazi talking points, which were amply reported on — were about Benghazi. And this document, as I said, was explicitly not about Benghazi, but about the general dynamic in the Arab — or in the Muslim world at the time.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the Rhodes e-mail addresses the “protests” that had sprung up around the Middle East that week — in fact, news coverage from the time went big on the unrest. Even so, Carney’s contention merits a challenge. Have a look at Judicial Watch’s June 2013 FOIA lawsuit. As the complaint makes clear, Judicial Watch in October 2012 sought the following documents from the State Department:\r\n\r\n    1) Copies of any updates and/or talking points given to Ambassador Rice by the White House or any federal agency concerning, regarding, or related to the September 11, 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.\r\n\r\n    2) Any and all records or communications concerning, regarding, or related to the talking points or updates on the Benghazi attack given to Ambassador Rice by the White House or any federal agency.\r\n\r\nIt was in response to this request — and the subsequent lawsuit — that Judicial Watch secured the Rhodes e-mail. That simple cause-and-effect renders Carney’s argument about the e-mail’s non-Benghaziness a bit shaky. Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, says, “Carney’s statement yesterday that it wasn’t a Benghazi document is ludicrous because this document was given to us in response to a FOIA lawsuit for the Benghazi talking points.”\r\n'
11e.txt,'title: Jason Chaffetz: Benghazi email ‘major’\r\n\r\nRep. Jason Chaffetz on Thursday blasted the Obama administration on Benghazi, calling it a “major, major scandal” and saying Jay Carney’s comments were “laughable.”\r\n\r\n“We have a major, major scandal,” the Utah Republican said on Fox News. “We have lies that are perpetuated by this White House.”\r\n\r\nChaffetz’s appearance came less than an hour before the House Oversight Committee, of which he is a member, was scheduled to hold a hearing on the Sept. 11, 2012 attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.\r\n\r\nChaffetz also said White House press secretary Jay Carney’s comments at a Wednesday press briefing were “embarrassing.”\r\n\r\n“Despite the White House saying this is a phony scandal — it was done a long time ago, what difference does it make — you have the White House press secretary in an embarrassing moment try to say the Ben Rhodes email had nothing to do with Benghazi. That is absolutely laughable.”\r\n\r\nAt the briefing, Carney said a recent email uncovered by Judicial Watch “was explicitly not about Benghazi.” The email in question, sent by deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes to top Obama administration officials, provided talking points for then-U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice’s appearances on the Sunday talk shows after the attacks.\r\n\r\nChaffetz also went after Hillary Clinton, who was serving as secretary of state when the attacks occurred. He said Clinton offered little support immediately after the incident, and that she “didn’t even speak with the president that night.” He said the administration “tried to come up with this lame story” that they couldn’t have gotten resources or help to the consulate in time, saying he is “worried that they didn’t even try to get there.”\r\n\r\nThe congressman said a select committee might be necessary to further investigate the attacks.\r\n\r\nChaffetz has been a frequent critic of the administration on its handling of Benghazi. In January, he accused the administration of “misleading the world and the people of the United States of America about what really happened.”\r\n\r\nRead more: http://www.politico.com/story/2014/05/jason-chaffetz-benghazi-email-major-106231.html#ixzz30axUaqVC\r\n'
12a.txt,'title: Obama, Merkel: Russia faces tougher sanctions if Ukraine election is disrupted\r\n\r\nPresident Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Friday that broad new economic sanctions would be imposed on Russia if its threat to eastern Ukraine disrupts the country’s presidential elections later this month.\r\n\r\nThe warning, delivered during a White House news conference, provided for the first time a specific threshold that Russia must not cross if it is to avoid further sanctions from Europe and the United States.\r\n\r\nThose measures could include sanctions against Russia’s lifeblood energy sector, banking system and mining industries, moves that would hurt Europe primarily but also ripple through the U.S. economy.\r\n\r\nFor weeks, the Obama administration has declined to specify what, short of a Russian invasion of eastern Ukraine, would trigger the most severe sanctions to date in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s seizure of Crimea and support for pro-Russian militias in eastern Ukraine.\r\n\r\nBut both leaders expressed reluctance to carry out the threat, a reflection of the deep European uncertainty over the costs of doing so.\r\n\r\n“The idea that you’re going to turn off the tap on all Russian oil or natural gas exports, I think, is unrealistic,” Obama said during the Rose Garden appearance. “But there are a range of, you know, approaches that can be taken not only in the energy sector but in the arms sector, the finance sector, in terms of lines of credit for trade, all that have a significant impact on Russia.”\r\n\r\nStanding next to Obama, Merkel acknowledged that “further sanctions will be unavoidable” if Ukraine is unable to hold the May 25 presidential elections, although she added that this is “something we do not want.”\r\n\r\nBut, she said, “We are firmly resolved to go down that road.”\r\n\r\nThe national vote is expected to help resolve the nation’s constitutional crisis that began with President Viktor Yanukovych’s flight from Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, in February amid protests over the corruption and pro-Russian policies of his government.\r\n\r\nThe leaders met as the crisis in eastern Ukraine worsened, raising fears of Russian military action despite the threat of further U.S. and European economic sanctions.\r\n\r\nUkraine’s government launched its most aggressive push to date against pro-Russian groups occupying government buildings in several eastern towns. Two government helicopters were shot down, and Putin warned the U.S.-brokered agreement reached last month in Geneva to reduce tensions had collapsed.\r\n\r\nPutin has already seized and annexed Crimea, a move the Obama administration does not recognize but acknowledges it can do little about. Obama has sought to prevent Putin, who has about 40,000 Russian troops on the Ukraine border, from pushing into the former Soviet republic through the threat of sanctions against whole sectors of the Russian economy.\r\n\r\nAdministration officials say such sanctions would have an adverse effect on the U.S. economy, although Germany and other European nations would feel the impact far more severely. How effective the threat of so-called sector sanctions is depends primarily on Europe’s willingness to impose them, a focus of Obama’s meeting with Merkel on Friday.\r\n\r\nObama said planning for sector sanctions has been “stepped up.” He also condemned as “disgraceful and inexcusable” the detention of monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, including a German citizen, by a pro-Russian group in eastern Ukraine.\r\n\r\nIn recent weeks, Obama and Vice President Biden have traveled to Europe to reassure NATO allies that the United States would honor the pact’s collective defense commitment, known as Article 5, should Russia enter a member country.\r\n\r\nBut Obama has also warned NATO member nations that, given Russia’s ambitions, each must also contribute fairly to the group’s defense, including more defense spending and new commitments of military resources.\r\n\r\nEchoing that message, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Friday that NATO members will be “judged harshly” if they do not increase defense spending in response to the new Russian threat.\r\n\r\n“For decades — from the early days of the Cold War — American defense secretaries have called on European allies to ramp up their defense investment,” Hagel said in a speech at the Wilson Center.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest obstacles, he said, has been a sense that the age of aggression in Europe was over. “Russia’s actions in Ukraine shatter that myth and usher in bracing new realities,” Hagel said.\r\n\r\nOnly a handful of NATO’s 28 members meet the agreed budget target of 2 percent of their gross domestic product.\r\n\r\n“We must see renewed financial commitments from all NATO members,” Hagel said.\r\n\r\nObama and Merkel have had a tumultuous relationship, with each at times accusing the other of missteps, mostly over issues related to the world economic recovery.\r\n\r\nEven in the early afterglow of Obama’s 2008 election, Merkel was unafraid to call on the popular new president to begin winding down stimulus spending long before others. Obama later urged Merkel to help bail out flagging Euro-zone nations in order to revive Europe’s economy, then a drag on the U.S. recovery.\r\n\r\nThe two fell out, though, last year after disclosures by the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, which included a “head of state” collection program that monitored Merkel’s personal cellphone. Obama said he was unaware that Merkel, raised in the East German police state, was a target and announced later it would no longer continue.\r\n\r\nObama said Friday he was “pained” that the disclosure had upset Merkel, calling her one of his “closest friends” among international leaders.\r\n\r\nThe leaders did not reach agreement on a deal to stop surveillance of each other’s governments — something Merkel had hoped to secure. During the news conference, she said the agreement would continue to be discussed in the weeks ahead.'
12b.txt,'title: Obama: U.S., Germany United in Imposing Costs on Russia Over Ukraine\r\n\r\nPresident Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned on Friday that Russia would face tougher sanctions if Moscow disrupts this month\'s presidential elections in Ukraine, setting a new and more aggressive marker for Western action.\r\n\r\n\"If Russia continues on its current course, we have a range of tools at our disposal, including sanctions that would target certain sectors of the Russian economy,\" Mr. Obama said during a news conference at the White House. \"And we\'ve been consulting closely with our European and G-7 partners, and we\'re stepping up our planning.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a two-hour meeting dominated by discussion of Ukraine, Mr. Obama and Ms. Merkel pointed to the May 25 elections as the next moment that could trigger broader, more punitive sanctions against segments of the Russian economy, such as banking, defense or energy. Ms. Merkel said if destabilization continues, \"further sanctions will be unavoidable.\"\r\n\r\n\"What we\'re talking about are sectoral measures,\" Ms. Merkel said.\r\n\r\nPreviously, Mr. Obama had only cited a full-scale Russian invasion as a move that would prompt the stronger measures, which are opposed by a range of companies, especially in Europe.\r\n\r\nBoth leaders left vague the question of how such sanctions would be crafted and said their discussions continue. Neither leader was specific about what kind of Russian actions around the Ukrainian election would trigger such an action.\r\n\r\nMr. Obama said Friday that targeting oil and gas sectors next might be unrealistic, given opposition from within the European Union, but there are other important sectors that could be hit.\r\n\r\n\"We\'re confident that we will have a package that will further impact Russia\'s growth and economy,\" Mr. Obama said. \"Our hope is that we don\'t have to deploy them.\"\r\n\r\nOne possible compromise could be for Germany to receive an exemption of sorts \"to mitigate certain economic impacts,\" a senior administration official said. It is also possible a deal could be reached to find sources other than Russia to meet Germany\'s energy needs. Russia currently supplies about a third of its oil and natural gas.\r\n\r\nEuropean officials said this week that one of the main difficulties in getting the U.S. and Europe in line on sanctions was how to ensure that no one country is disproportionately affected. Sanctions on the financial sector would hurt the U.K. most, energy sanctions would disproportionately ding the Germans, and defense sanctions would hurt the French.\r\n\r\nEuropean officials also want to keep some powder dry so they can keep turning up the heat.\r\n\r\nStanding together in the Rose Garden, Mr. Obama and Ms. Merkel emphasized points of agreement, saying that the U.S. and Europe have been unified in supporting the Ukrainian government and in imposing costs on Russia. They made little mention of the areas where they diverge.\r\n\r\nGermany, with its close economic ties to Moscow and leading role in Europe, is critical to Mr. Obama\'s effort to build an international coalition to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to ease off on Ukraine. U.S. attempts to change Russia\'s course through sanctions would be severely hampered without Berlin\'s support.\r\n\r\nMs. Merkel has been a vocal critic of Mr. Putin\'s actions in Ukraine, and Mr. Obama has relied on her to convey to the Russian leader the economic consequences Moscow would face if he doesn\'t stand down. She spoke with Mr. Putin on Thursday about pro-Russian separatists taking hostage several military observers in eastern Ukraine, including four Germans.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Obama, who has a closer relationship with Ms. Merkel than he does with many other foreign leaders, so far has been unable to convince her to get on board with the kind of tough sanctions the U.S. supports.\r\n\r\nMs. Merkel said a May 12 meeting of EU ministers would provide an opportunity to discuss a range of options, as she underscored the importance of continued cooperation with the U.S.\r\n\r\n\"The United States of America and the European Union need to act in concert here, and they have done so in the past, and they\'re going to continue to do so,\" she said.\r\n\r\nComplicating matters is the continuing tension between the U.S. and Germany over revelations from Edward Snowden that the National Security Agency tapped Ms. Merkel\'s cellphone in the past. The two sides have thus far been unable to come to an agreement over rules of the road for spying among allies.\r\n\r\n\"Angela Merkel is one of my closest friends on the world stage and somebody whose partnership I deeply value,\" the president said. \"And so it has pained me to see the degree to which the Snowden disclosures have created strains in the relationship.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Obama said he was committed to a U.S.-German \"cyber dialogue\" to ensure clarity about U.S. goals and intentions.\r\n\r\nMs. Merkel said the debate about spying had revealed that \"we have a few difficulties yet to overcome.\"'
12c.txt,'title: Obama, Merkel vow wider Russia sanctions if Ukraine election impeded\r\n\r\nU.S. President Barack Obama said on Friday the United States would move to \"sectoral sanctions\" on Russia if Moscow impeded plans for elections in Ukraine later this month.\r\n\r\nObama was speaking to reporters at the White House after talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who also supported a move to wider sanctions and said the European Union and the United States would continue to work in concert on the issue.\r\n\r\n\"The next step is going to be a broader-based sectoral sanctions regime,\" Obama said. Merkel agreed, saying that May 25 was a critical date and \"we will see to it that elections can take place.\"\r\n\r\nThe United States and the EU have imposed several rounds of sanctions on individuals and some companies to try to persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt any interference in Russian-speaking areas of eastern Ukraine.\r\n\r\nEnergy and banking sectors are two of the most likely areas if those sanctions are widened.\r\n\r\n\"In Europe, we have taken a decision that (should) further destabilization happen, we will move to a third stage of sanctions. I would like to underline this is not necessarily what we want, but we are ready and prepared to go to such a step,\" Merkel said.\r\n\r\nObama said the purpose of sanctions was not to punish Russia, but to give it an incentive \"to choose a better path.\"\r\n\r\nObama called on Russia to persuade pro-Russian military groups in Ukraine to stand down and said it was disgraceful that the militias were holding international observers.\r\n\r\nThe two leaders said they were united in their desire to impose costs on Russia for its actions in Ukraine and for backing Ukraine, including financially.\r\n\r\n\"We\'re united in our support for Ukraine, including the very important IMF program approved this week,\" Obama said, referring to the approval of a $17 billion two-year aid program for Ukraine.\r\n\r\nHe said the Russian account of events in eastern Ukraine that there was a spontaneous uprising by pro-Russian activists was belied by the use on Friday of surface-to-air missiles that brought down two of Ukraine\'s military helicopters.\r\n\r\n\"It is obvious to the world that these Russian-backed groups are not peaceful protesters. They are heavily armed militants,\" Obama said.'
12d.txt,'title: Obama, Merkel threaten broader sanctions against Russia over Ukraine\r\n\r\nPresident Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday ratcheted up the threat of economic backlash against Russia, saying they are preparing broader sanctions if Moscow continues to stoke violence in eastern Ukraine in the run-up to elections later this month.\r\n\r\n“The Russian leadership must know that if it continues to destabilize eastern Ukraine and disrupt this month\'s presidential election, we will move quickly on additional steps, including further sanctions that will impose greater costs,” Obama said during a joint news conference in the Rose Garden.\r\n\r\nAfter weeks of threatening to impose sanctions on sectors of the Russian economy, Obama and Merkel appeared to be refining the trigger point for enacting the tougher penalties that could cause pain to Europe as well as Russia. In previous remarks, Obama had only specified that the sanctions would come if Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThe new red line comes as violence in eastern Ukraine has increased with the fledgling government in Kiev struggling to subdue pro-Russian separatists. Western powers say Moscow is behind the insurgents and has broken its promise to urge them to stand down.\r\n\r\nTalk of the U.S. and European response to the continuing crisis dominated Merkel’s brief visit to Washington on Friday. The two leaders sought to present a united front against Russia, despite the open rift between the nations on another hot topic -- U.S. spying.\r\n\r\nRevelations that U.S. intelligence agencies listened in on Merkel’s phone calls have caused sustained tensions between Berlin and Washington. Attempts to craft a new agreement outlining the rules of the road for spying between U.S. and Germany have so far failed.\r\n\r\nMerkel raised the issue in the news conference, noting that the two sides had not yet reached a deal and that the matter “will require further discussion.”\r\n\r\nObama sought to reassure German citizens that the U.S. is not vacuuming up all of their phone conversations and email correspondence, saying, “Ordinary Germans are not subject to continual surveillance.” He also pushed back on reports that the U.S. had offered and then rescinded a “no-spy agreement” to the French, which has angered Germans who have sought similar assurances.\r\n\r\n“We do not have a blanket no-spy agreement with any country, with any of our closest partners,” Obama said, adding that the United States was working with various allies to address concerns that have arisen after former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked documents that disclosed the extent of U.S. spying.\r\n\r\nThe president also commented on a domestic controversy: the botched execution of a convicted murderer in Oklahoma. The incident has prompted a state investigation into death penalty procedures.\r\n\r\nObama, who supports capital punishment in some cases, said the Oklahoma execution raises “significant questions about how the death penalty is being applied” and said he had asked Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. to produce a review of federal work on problems with the death penalty.\r\n\r\n“I think we do have to, as a society, ask ourselves some difficult and profound questions around these issues,” Obama said.\r\n'
12e.txt,'title: Obama Suggests New Trigger for Broader Russia Sanctions\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to sanctions on Russia, invasion of Ukraine isn’t such a clear red line, but President Obama added a fresh “trigger” to broader sanctions today when he warned Moscow that an attempt to disrupt Ukraine elections could provoke them.\r\n\r\nPreviously, administration officials have indicated that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would prompt tougher economic actions by the U.S. and its allies.\r\n\r\nSo far, the U.S. and EU have levied two rounds of sanctions, the first aimed at a handful of Russian officials, the second at a larger set of Russian officials and companies. The White House has warned that more serious sanctions are possible.\r\n\r\nBut it’s been unclear what, exactly, Russia must do to trigger more sanctions. Invasion has been the clearest trigger listed yet. Russia has kept 40,000 troops on its border with Ukraine, NATO has estimated.\r\n\r\n“For instance, should they move their troops into Ukraine across the border, we have made very clear through the G7 and with our European allies that very robust sectoral sanctions on the Russian economy could be imposed,” a senior administration official told reporters on a conference call, when the last round of sanctions was imposed.\r\n\r\nBroader sanctions would be in order “if Russia continues to escalate the situation,” another administration official told reporters March 24.\r\n\r\nToday, President Obama said broader sanctions could be levied on Russia even if it doesn’t invade Ukraine, that they could be invoked if Russia seeks to disrupt the upcoming May 25 presidential election in Ukraine.\r\n\r\nAppearing in the White House Rose Garden with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who visited as conflict in Eastern Ukraine escalated sharply, Obama said: “[I]f in fact we see the disruptions and the destabilization continuing so severely that it impedes elections on May 25, we will not have a choice but to move forward with additional, more severe sanctions.”\r\n\r\nThat trigger depends on EU willingness to cooperate. Both times Obama has pushed for sanctions, the U.S. spent weeks warning about the threat of sanctions while it communicated with European allies to rally support.\r\n\r\nSanctioning Russian companies or goods means that European and American companies can’t do business with them, and Europe will likely see greater effects of sanctions than America. Europe consumes natural gas from Russia, and Eastern European countries have deep economic and trade ties with Russia. A sudden ban on doing business can hurt them–a fact Obama acknowledged in the Rose Garden noting that some of the 28 EU countries are more “vulnerable” to Russian retaliation than others.\r\n\r\nWithout going into many specifics, Obama acknowledged some limits to sanctions.\r\n\r\n“The idea that you’re going to turn off the tap on all Russian oil or natural gas exports I think is unrealistic. But there are a range of, you know, approaches that can be taken not only in the energy sector but in the arms sector, the finance sector, in terms of lines of credit for trade, all that have a significant impact on Russia,” Obama said.\r\n'
13a.txt,'title: Florida lawmakers approve medical marijuana bill\r\n\r\nFlorida legislators voted on Friday to allow doctors to prescribe a special strain of \"non-euphoric\" marijuana for treatment of chronic epileptic seizures and some other severe illnesses.\r\n\r\n   Governor Rick Scott said he will sign the bill into law when it reaches his desk.\r\n\r\n\"They definitely made a difference in many people\'s lives today. It was historic,\" said Ron Watson, a lobbyist whose 8-year-old son, Dylan, died of leukemia.\r\n\r\nWatson and several other parents, many wheeling their stricken children into the Capitol, testified at committee hearings and contacted House and Senate members throughout this year\'s 60-day session of the Florida Legislature.\r\n\r\nThe parents advocated strictly controlled legalization of a special form of marijuana known as \"Charlotte\'s Web,\" named for a Colorado girl whose epileptic seizures have shown some response to the drug.\r\n\r\n   The substance is not for smoking. It is specially cultivated to be very low in tetrhydrocannabinol (THC), the element that gets users high, and also very low in cannabidiol (CBD), which eases seizures in the brain.\r\n\r\n   \"I\'m a parent and a grandparent,\" Scott told reporters on Thursday. \"I want to make sure my children, my grandchildren, have the access to the health care they want.\"\r\n\r\n   The Senate voted 30-9 to send the bill to Scott on Friday.\r\n\r\n   That vote, and the 111-7 House passage a day earlier, marked a rare example of strong bipartisanship in the Republican-dominated Legislature.\r\n\r\nThe proposal was tightly drawn to allay fears of conservative lawmakers who generally oppose easing drug laws while allowing a \"compassionate use\" registry for the oil or vapor extract of a specially grown marijuana strain that is extremely low in the intoxicating ingredient pot users enjoy.\r\n\r\n   The bill does not legalize marijuana in smoking form, but authorizes designation of five dispensaries operated by established nursery owners, who will cultivate the special blend under closely regulated conditions.\r\n\r\nThe bill is not related to a constitutional amendment on November\'s Florida ballot by a public petition campaign that would allow doctors to prescribe regular marijuana for patients with severe disabilities.\r\n\r\n   It is estimated that Florida has 125,000 epilepsy sufferers. The House amended the bill to allow use of the drug for cancer and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, known as Lou Gehrig\'s Disease.\r\n\r\n   Representative Dennis Baxley, a Republican, said he could not support the legislation. Despite tight legal restrictions, and although the low-THC strain cannot get users high, he said he feared it was a first step toward legalizing more drugs.\r\n\r\n\"This could be the rifle shot that starts a massive avalanche,\" Baxley said.'
13b.txt,'title: Gov. Rick Scott says he backs medical marijuana bill\r\n\r\nThe Florida House confounded the naysayers and agreed to legalize a limited strain of marijuana for a specific list of medical purposes, bringing the last-chance remedy closer to reality for thousands of Floridians suffering with epilepsy.\r\n\r\nAs the families of children with intractable epilepsy watched from the public gallery, the House voted 111-7 and sent a compromise bill to the Senate, which is expected to approve it and send it to the governor Friday, the final day of the legislative session. Gov. Rick Scott surprised supporters and told reporters late Thursday that if they pass it, he will sign it.\r\n\r\nThe House vote came after 45 minutes of emotional debate as legislators from both sides of the aisle spoke about their initial reluctance to support the bill only to be persuaded after realizing it was narrowly drawn and had immediate potential to save lives.\r\n\r\n“If we do not act today with the safety net and the provisions in this bill, those children will die,” said Rep. Ray Pilon, R-Sarasota, a former police officer and one of 34 co-sponsors of the bill, SB 1030. “I plead with you. Reach down into your hearts. Are we really doing to harm these children? I don’t think so. Do we have a great possibility of saving their lives? Absolutely.”\r\n\r\nMore than 125,000 people suffer from severe epilepsy in Florida and the bill authorizes doctors to order low-THC cannabis for use by patients suffering from chronic seizures. The House bill also allows the specific strains of cannabis to cover cancer and persistent muscle spasms, including Lou Gehrig’s disease and other chronic conditions.\r\n\r\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Shalimar, the prime sponsor of the bill, called it a “very cautious step for those very sick children, without cracking open the door too far to inappropriate use.”\r\n\r\nFive dispensaries throughout the state, operated by nurserymen who have been registered in Florida for at least 30 years, must be licensed to provide access to the drug. The dispensaries must show they can cultivate non-euphoric marijuana, have the appropriate financial stability and have its operators undergo a background check.\r\n\r\nAuthorized patients will be allowed access to the drug through oil or vapor form, but it may not be smoked. The House reached a compromise with the Senate to reduce the number of ailments covered by the legalized marijuana.\r\n\r\n“While I wanted this to be on Alzheimer’s, PTSD, we have compromised with the Senate and only added cancer,” Gaetz said. “There are specific conditions that you must have and, if you don’t, you will commit a criminally culpable act.”\r\n\r\nRep. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, voted against the measure, but commended Gaetz for putting together a narrowly crafted bill.\r\n\r\n“This could be the rifle shot that creates a massive avalanche,” he said. “I pray it’s not. I pray it hits the target, meets this need and shows people the right way … I simply can’t pull the trigger.”\r\n\r\nThe bill also establishes a compassionate use registry to list patients and requires a doctor to verify that before a patient is authorized to use low-THC cannabis when no other treatment can be used. Patients must consent they know the risks.\r\n\r\nThe bill also authorizes the University of Florida College of Pharmacy to conduct research to determine the most effective treatment.\r\n\r\nRep. Gayle Harrell, R-Stuart, tried to amend the bill to allow for a research program to develop marijuana-based drugs that would then be approved approved by the FDA. It was overwhelmingly rejected.\r\n\r\n“This is essentially to make sure that we have a medical model for this,” she said. “and we know whether these drugs are efficacious and safe.”\r\n\r\nRep. Debbie Mayfield, R-Vero Beach, who replaced her husband in the state House after he died of esophageal cancer, said her husband died after his experimental treatment ended because it had not been approved by the FDA.\r\n\r\n“The FDA is not the answer to waiting for people who need treatment,” she said. “If they need treatment. They need it now.”\r\n\r\nSupporting the amendment: the Florida Sheriffs Association, the Florida Polices Chiefs Association, the Florida Medical Association and the Florida Osteopathic Association.\r\n\r\nRep. Katie Edwards, D-Plantation, who has compiled a two-inch thick document of medical research about the value of cannabis in treating chronic ailments, said she “never thought we’d get to this.” With tears in her eyes, she urged her colleagues to “hit the green button,” and vote yes. “It is the right thing to do.”\r\n\r\nBefore the vote, Gaetz looked to the families in the gallery and thanked them for their commitment to their children.\r\n\r\n“We would not be here without the love of parents,” he said. “This is an exceptional love and it is a special kind of love that special children can instill.”\r\n\r\nThe chamber then broke into applause, waived the rules and overwhelmingly sent the bill to the Senate for a final vote.\r\n\r\nRead more here: http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/05/01/4092364/house-oks-medical-marijuana-bill.html#storylink=cpy'
13c.txt,'title: Florida’s Scott shows Crist-like ideological dexterity\r\n\r\nA Florida gubernatorial candidate who won the governor’s mansion by appealing to the far right on everything from immigration to health care reform is singing a surprisingly different tune as he seeks office again. But it’s not former governor Charlie Crist, the Republican-turned-Democrat who’s changed his position on issues across the ideological landscape; it’s Crist’s successor, Gov. Rick Scott (R).\r\n\r\nScott, whose approval ratings are dismally underwater and who trails Crist in the governor’s race in most public polls, has said this week he will sign legislation allowing the children of undocumented workers to pay in-state tuition when they attend universities. He also signaled he will sign a measure to legalize the use of a medical marijuana extract to treat patients suffering from epilepsy and other diseases.\r\n\r\nBoth positions stand at odds with Scott’s earlier actions. In 2010, Scott advocated a crackdown on illegal immigrants living in Florida, on par with a similar bill that generated controversy in Arizona. Last year, he vetoed legislation that would allow undocumented immigrants to obtain a driver’s license.\r\n\r\nAnd just a few months ago, Scott said he would vote against a ballot initiative that would legalize marijuana for medical uses.\r\n\r\n“Having seen the terrible effects of alcohol and drug abuse first-hand, I cannot endorse sending Florida down this path, and I would personally vote against [the initiative],” Scott said in January. “No matter my personal beliefs, however, a ballot initiative would be up to the voters to decide.”\r\n\r\nThis week, Scott reversed himself. “I’m a parent and a grandparent,” Scott told the Associated Press. “I want to make sure my children, my grandchildren have access to the health care they want.”\r\n\r\nScott has even reversed himself on part of the Affordable Care Act. Scott initially said he would not move to expand Medicaid in Florida after the Supreme Court left the decision up to states. Less than a year later, in 2013, Scott said he would press legislators to expand Medicaid for three years.\r\n\r\n“While the federal government is committed to paying 100 percent of the cost of new people in Medicaid, I cannot, in good conscience, deny the uninsured access to care,” Scott said at the time (The legislature has so far resisted Scott’s call to expand Medicaid.)\r\n\r\nDemocrats say Scott’s flip-flops are little more than an election year gambit for votes. “It’s fair to assume every decision he is making right now is to stay in office, and not for the people,” said Kevin Cate, a spokesman for Crist’s campaign.\r\n\r\nScott’s campaign said the governor has been clear about his priorities — “lower taxes for our families, lower tuition for our students and fair access to education for all Floridians,” said Greg Blair, a campaign spokesman. “Gov. Scott has delivered those major victories and will proudly spend the next six months comparing his accomplishments with Charlie Crist’s record.”\r\n\r\nScott is not a man of half-measures. His first foray into politics involved spending millions of his own dollars on advertisements against the Affordable Care Act. He spent $78 million more to win the governorship in 2010 and pushed a conservative-backed legislative agenda.\r\n\r\nNow, facing daunting poll numbers — a Quinnipiac University survey released earlier this week showed Scott trailing Crist by 48 percent to 38 percent– Scott is reaching out to the center, and especially to Hispanic voters crucial to winning statewide in Florida.\r\n\r\nScott won a bare majority, 50 percent, of the Hispanic vote in 2010, when he beat Democrat Alex Sink by a single percentage point. The Quinnipiac poll showed Scott trailing Crist among Hispanics by a 46 percent to 28 percent margin. That alone could be enough to hand Crist the election.\r\n\r\nRepairing the damage means embracing the in-state tuition bill: The Quinnipiac poll showed 55 percent of voters agreed that an illegal immigrant who attended high school in Florida should be allowed to pay in-state tuition at a state university.\r\n\r\nIt also means embracing medical marijuana. Some Democrats hoped that the initiative, which qualified for the ballot earlier this year, would drive turnout among younger voters, who are more likely to sit out midterm elections. A Quinnipiac poll from last year showed 82 percent of Floridians thought marijuana should be legal for medical use.\r\n\r\nBut don’t expect Crist to attack Scott’s evolving positions. After all, the candidate once known as “Chain Gang Charlie” now backs legalizing marijuana for medical uses.'
13d.txt,'title: Fla. lawmakers OK bill on medical marijuana strain\r\n\r\nA strain of low-potency marijuana would be legal in Florida to treat epilepsy and cancer patients under a bill passed by the Legislature on Friday.\r\n\r\nThe measure — met with skepticism when first proposed — passed with strong support in both chambers after lawmakers heard stories of children suffering from seizures who could be helped by the marijuana strain, known as Charlotte\'s Web.\r\n\r\nThe bill passed the Senate 30-9 Friday, a day after the House supported it 111-7. Gov. Rick Scott has said he\'ll sign it.\r\n\r\nBill sponsor Sen. Rob Bradley said months ago that he would have been the last person in the chamber to support it because as a former prosecutor he takes tough positions on drugs. Then he researched the issue and heard stories of children it\'s helped and said he couldn\'t say no.\r\n\r\n\"I looked at my daughter and said, \'How can I not do this?\'\" Bradley, R-Orange Park, said. \"If I come over here to be compassionate toward my fellow man, to be compassionate toward the children that we try to protect with so many things that we\'ve done, what kind of message would I be sending to my child if I simply said, \'You know what? This would be too risky politically.\'\"\r\n\r\nRayAnn Moseley, an 11-year-old girl who has up to 300 seizures a week, is part of what swayed Bradley. Her parents, Peyton and Holley Moseley, have been fighting to get the bill passed, and Bradley said he has kept a photo of the girl on his desk since meeting her father.\r\n\r\n\"I\'m looking forward to the day RayAnn gets to take her first treatment and to next year to be able to come back and brag and say \'Oh my goodness! Look at her now!\'\" Holley Mosely said. \"It makes me proud for her. She\'s changing Florida law. She\'s making history here.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the vote, RayAnn gave key lawmakers paintings she made of the sun shining and the words \"RAY OF HOPE.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill puts strong restrictions on the use of the drug. It can have no more than 0.8 percent THC, the chemical that makes users feel high. On average, marijuana has about 15 percent THC, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The strain has normal levels of cannabidiol, or CBD, which is used to treat seizures.\r\n\r\nAlso, people would not be able to just walk into a doctor\'s office and get a prescription. Only doctors have who have been providing ongoing treatment of a patient can prescribe it, and only as a last resort if other treatments aren\'t effective.\r\n\r\nThe state would maintain a registry of eligible patients. The marijuana can\'t be smoked and would be converted into an oil. Only four dispensaries would be allowed in the state, and they would be highly regulated. And only nurseries that have existed in the state for 30 years could grow it, a provision that concerned lawmakers because it would severely limit the number of potential growers.\r\n\r\nRepublican Senate President Don Gaetz said he was skeptical of the idea at first, but he voted for it Friday.\r\n\r\n\"Those who changed hearts were the parents and children who came here and camped out here and were so self-effacing, so undemanding, but so persuasive and so eloquent in their suffering,\" said Gaetz, whose son Rep. Matt Gaetz sponsored the House bill.\r\n\r\n\"I\'m proud of my son for having the political courage and the human compassion to champion this issue,\" Gaetz said.'
13e.txt,'title: House, Gov. Scott back medical marijuana bill\r\n\r\nGov. Rick Scott said he will sign a medical marijuana bill poised to pass the Florida Senate, after the measure received overwhelming support today from the House as children whose lives hang in the balance looked on.\r\n\r\n“I’m a parent and a grandparent. I want to make sure my children, my grandchildren, have the access to the health care they want. So, I know the House has passed the bill. It’s going back to the Senate. If it passes, I’m going to sign it,” Scott told reporters this evening.\r\n\r\nScott had wanted to limit access to the drug, not approved by the Food and Drug Administration, to patients with a variety of illnesses who are involved in clinical trials.\r\n\r\nThe version (SB 1030) approved by the House in a 111-7 vote and sent back to the Senate --- with one day left in the annual legislative session --- includes language proposed by Scott but goes much farther.\r\n\r\nUnder the measure, cancer patients as well as those who suffer from severe muscle spasms or seizures and who do not respond to other treatment would be eligible for a strain of marijuana that is high in cannabidiol (CBD) and low in euphoria-inducing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Supporters have particularly said the substance could help children who suffer from a type of epilepsy that causes severe seizures.\r\n\r\nDoctors, who would have to receive special training, would put their patients on a statewide “compassionate use” registry maintained by the Department of Health. Doctors would also have to submit patients’ treatment plans for the substance to the University of Florida pharmacy school. Patients could be charged with misdemeanors for faking a disease and doctors could be charged with misdemeanors for ordering the drug for patients who don’t fit the criteria.\r\n\r\nThe House also added new requirements for growers. Under the proposal, only large, commercial nurseries would be eligible to grow the low-THC cannabis. Growers must possess a valid certificate of registration issued by the Department of Agriculture for the cultivation of more than 400,000 plants, post a $5 million bond, and have operated as a registered nursery in Florida for at least 30 years. Growers would also manufacture the low-THC substance, usually delivered in paste or oil form, and serve as distribution centers. The state would authorize five distribution centers spread throughout the state.\r\n\r\nRep. Matt Caldwell, R-Lehigh Acres, said about three dozen nurseries would fit the criteria spelled out in his amendment.\r\n\r\nFrom the public gallery, a handful of Panhandle families --- including Holley Moseley and her daughter, RayAnn --- watched House members debate the issue. The Moseleys have led the charge in the Capitol on behalf of about 150,000 families whose children could benefit from the treatment.\r\n\r\nAfter the vote, an emotional Holley Moseley could not hold back tears when surrounded by reporters. Moseley said that RayAnn had suffered numerous seizures during the hours that she and her daughter sat waiting for the vote.\r\n\r\n“It really was overwhelming. I’ve kind of held it together until this point. We’re so close,” Moseley said. “Just sitting there next to her, and seizure after seizure. It just makes it so real.”\r\n\r\nThe seeming contradiction of Florida’s conservative, Republican-dominated Legislature approving any pot-related legislation was not lost on some of the members.\r\n\r\nRepublican Rep. Eric Eisnaugle, who returned to the House less than a month ago after winning a special election, said he was “both skeptical and concerned” when he learned about the issue coming up in the Legislature.\r\n\r\n“I can hardly believe I’m saying this. … I’m going to vote for the bill because I think it’s the right thing to do,” Eisnaugle, R-Orlando, said.\r\n\r\nBut, as limited as the bill is, authorizing medical marijuana “could be the rifle shot that starts an avalanche,” objected Rep. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala.\r\n\r\n“I pray it’s not,” he said. “But because of that risk of setting off that giant avalanche … that weight and my responsibility is a knot in my stomach that says you started that. I simply can’t pull the trigger.”\r\n\r\nBut Rep. Matt Gaetz, the bill’s sponsor, said he recognizes that some critics say lawmakers are sending the message that marijuana use is acceptable.\r\n\r\n“But I look up at the gallery at these children who are racing to their deaths and I just can’t balance the impact of their life against that argument. We are being as cautious as we can,” Gaetz, R-Fort Walton Beach, said. “That’s why we’ve taken this cautious step only with tightly controlled non-euphoric marijuana. I’m sure it’s not perfect. But it is my best effort … to do right by those very ill children without cracking the door open too much.”\r\n\r\nThe Senate is expected to pass the measure on Friday and send it to the governor.'

Not Right Now\r\n\r\nAn attempt to create a banking system for Colorado’s now legal marijuana businesses survived only a few hours before being effectively killed off Thursday.\r\n\r\nThe plan, which would have created a credit union for pot-related businesses unable to gain access to the regular banking system, cleared a state legislative committee early Thursday, paving the way for the world’s first financial system for the bud trade.\r\n\r\nHowever, another committee killed the plan shortly after by amending the bill to require Colorado to keep trying to find a way for the marijuana businesses to enter mainstream banking.\r\n\r\nMarijuana firms in Colorado and Washington state, the two states that have legalized pot for recreational use, have struggled to find a way to handle the large amounts of cash they make, because the funds are derived from a substance that remains illegal under federal law.\r\n\r\nIn February, the Justice and Treasury departments issued guidance suggesting that banks could offer basic services to marijuana dealers, but financial institutions remain wary. Consensus is growing that it will take an act of Congress to change the situation.\r\n\r\n“I have long said the issue cannot be solved at the [state] capitol, and I don’t hold the current Congress in high esteem to get anything done,” the bill’s co-sponsor Pat Steadman told the Denver Post.\r\n\r\n“But this bill would lay it squarely at their feet and force the conversation.”'
14b.txt,'title: Colorado lawmakers shy away from pot bank\r\n\r\nA Colorado plan to set up the world’s first financial system for marijuana survived less than 24 hours before state lawmakers changed course Thursday night and shelved the idea.\r\n\r\nThe proposal would have allowed state-licensed marijuana businesses to create a financial co-op, sort of an uninsured credit union.\r\n\r\nThe measure was introduced late Wednesday and cleared a House committee on Thursday. But a few hours later, another House committee gutted the plan by amending the bill to say that Colorado will continue studying the problem of marijuana businesses having a hard time accessing banking services.\r\n\r\nLawmakers from both parties expressed reservations about whether the financial-services plan would work.\r\n\r\n“Let’s take some time to have this properly vetted,” said Rep. Kevin Priola, R-Henderson, who sponsored the amendment to study the matter.\r\n\r\nThe measure would have allowed state-licensed marijuana businesses to create a financial co-op, sort of an uninsured credit union. The U.S. Federal Reserve would still have to grant permission for the co-ops to provide banking services like checking and credit.\r\n\r\nSponsors acknowledged the plan was a long-shot attempt to again try to move the marijuana away from its cash-only roots without running afoul of federal law. Colorado has struggled for years to find ways to help its pot industry access banks.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know whether this will take an act of Congress or an act of God at this point,” joked Rep. Jonathan Singer, D-Longmont and sponsor of the bill.\r\n\r\nBanking groups testified that Colorado’s co-op attempt was destined for failure. State lawmakers tried but failed two years ago to set up a state-chartered bank for the marijuana industry.\r\n\r\n “We really do not believe that that will work,” said Don Childers, head of the Colorado Bankers Association.\r\n\r\n“It is flatly illegal to deal in any illegal substance or any proceeds therefrom,” said Childers, who testified that the banking guidance issued in February only made banks less likely to accept risky marijuana clients.\r\n\r\nColorado’s new marijuana coordinator, an office within the executive branch, signed on to the plan, saying it can’t hurt even if it doesn’t work.\r\n\r\n“It’s the next logical step forward,” Andrew Freedman said.\r\n\r\nBut lawmakers weren’t persuaded.\r\n\r\n“It seems like we’re throwing spaghetti noodles against the wall to see if they stick,” said Rep. Chris Holbert, R-Parker.'
14c.txt,'title: Cannabis credit union? Colo. bill would create banking option for pot businesses\r\n\r\nColorado legislators proposed the creation of local financial-service cooperatives — the business equivalent of a credit union — for legal marijuana shops as a way to force federal authorities to decide definitively whether the pot industry can access critical banking services.\r\n\r\nIn a novel twist on the credit-union concept, which limits membership to individuals, Rep. Jonathan Singer, D-Boulder, offered House Bill 1398, which would create “cannabis credit co-ops” for licensed pot businesses and those who do business with them.\r\n\r\n(UPDATE: House Bill 1398 got off to a strong start Thursday in the House Business Committee, only, to get gutted late that evening in the House Finance Committee before House Appropriations restored the original version Friday morning and sent the measure to a vote on the House floor. Details here)\r\n\r\n“This sets up a structure of a new type of financial structure to the gap we’re seeing between banking and the marijuana industry,” Singer said during testimony Thursday afternoon. “It’s the only solution we see.”\r\n\r\nThough the bill allows the creation of co-ops similar to a credit union, their access to the nation’s financial banking system would require approval from the Federal Reserve Bank.\r\n\r\nWithout that approval, the co-op system could not operate.\r\n\r\n“This is a message to the federal government to say we are ready to go,” Singer said. “Start with a template, then ask for federal approval, sending a very clear message.”\r\n\r\nDespite the vote, the bill initially met with mixed opinions.\r\n\r\n“Anything we do at the state level is not going to get around the issue of money laundering without the cooperation of the federal government and the Federal Reserve,” Rep. Chris Holbert, R-Parker, said. “Aren’t we building a system that puts these co-ops in the business of money laundering?”\r\n\r\nBankers say Colorado’s co-op solution is unlikely to work — mostly because the bill requires permission from the Federal Reserve, which hasn’t said whether it would, or could, OK access — leaving Congress to find a way to break the stand-off.\r\n\r\n“We have no problem with them trying it,” said Don Childears, CEO of the Colorado Bankers Association, which is neutral on the bill. “But when it won’t work, the message to Congress is that we’re all done at the state level and they have to focus and deal with it.”\r\n\r\nThe idea for forming co-ops came from credit unions unsuccessfully wanting to form for the industry, according to Andrew Freedman, Colorado’s director of marijuana coordination.\r\n\r\nThe hope, Freedman said, is to bring the model to the Federal Reserve and demand an answer to whether marijuana businesses can finally enter the banking system.\r\n\r\n“We will be in a strong position to lobby Congress if we’ve tried every avenue to get into the system,” Freedman said, adding it would take about a year for the co-op structure to form.\r\n\r\nChildears said he doubts the system would gain Federal Reserve approval, mostly because marijuana remains illegal under federal law.\r\n\r\n“If I’m wrong, I’ll be the first to admit it and wish them well,” he said of the proposal. “But I don’t think I’m wrong.”\r\n\r\nColorado Attorney General John Suthers agreed to remain neutral on the bill only if the provision requiring Federal Reserve permission remained.\r\n\r\nA spokesman at the Federal Reserve Bank refused to comment about the bill or the concept of a co-op system.\r\n\r\nCo-sponsor Sen. Pat Steadman, D-Denver, agreed the bill doesn’t actually solve the problem with marijuana and banking.\r\n\r\n“I have long said the issue cannot be solved at the (state) Capitol, and I don’t hold the current Congress in high esteem to get anything done,” he said. “But this bill would lay it squarely at their feet and force the conversation.”\r\n\r\nThe co-ops would be regulated by the state commissioner of financial services, Chris Myklebust.\r\n\r\n“These folks are used to risk and this is one of the greatest social experiments that I’ve witnessed,” Myklebust said. “The risk exists but puts the onus on the entrepreneurial community willing to take that risk.”\r\n\r\nUnable to easily get banking services — marijuana remains illegal under federal laws that also control the nation’s banking system — pot shops, medicinal and recreational, have struggled with how best to handle the millions of dollars in cash that flows through their registers.\r\n\r\nThough federal authorities — bank regulators and prosecutors — earlier this year gave guidance for banks wanting to handle marijuana business deposits, most in the industry said it was little more than limited assurance that they could do so without legal reprisal.\r\n\r\nEfforts at Congressional reform have stalled, with bills designed to give specific permission for banks to accommodate marijuana businesses still awaiting committee hearings.\r\n\r\nThe state bill does not require deposit insurance, as regular banks and credit unions must have. That could be a problem, Childears said.\r\n\r\n“You need (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) or National Credit Union (Administration) insurance to be a (Federal Reserve) member,” Childears said. “It’s specifically articulated in the Federal Reserve Act. It’s black and white.”\r\n\r\nThe insurance carries restrictions, including prohibitions on knowingly doing business with illegal enterprises, he explained.\r\n\r\n“This is simply not a simple solution,” Childears said.\r\n\r\n'

But a few hours later, another House committee gutted the plan by amending the bill to say that Colorado will continue studying the problem of marijuana businesses having a hard time accessing banking services.\r\n\r\nLawmakers from both parties expressed reservations about whether the financial-services plan would work.\r\n\r\n\"Let\'s take some time to have this properly vetted,\" said Rep. Kevin Priola, R-Henderson, who sponsored the amendment to study the matter.\r\n\r\nThe measure would have allowed state-licensed marijuana businesses to create a financial co-op, sort of an uninsured credit union. The U.S. Federal Reserve would still have to grant permission for the co-ops to provide banking services like checking and credit.\r\n\r\nSponsors acknowledged the plan was a long-shot attempt to again try to move the marijuana away from its cash-only roots without running afoul of federal law. Colorado has struggled for years to find ways to help its pot industry access banks.\r\n\r\n\"I don\'t know whether this will take an act of Congress or an act of God at this point,\" joked Rep. Jonathan Singer, D-Longmont and sponsor of the bill.\r\n\r\nBanking groups testified that Colorado\'s co-op attempt was destined for failure. State lawmakers tried but failed two years ago to set up a state-chartered bank for the marijuana industry.\r\n\r\n\"We really do not believe that that will work,\" said Don Childers, head of the Colorado Bankers Association.\r\n\r\n\"It is flatly illegal to deal in any illegal substance or any proceeds therefrom,\" said Childers, who testified that the banking guidance issued in February only made banks less likely to accept risky marijuana clients.\r\n\r\nColorado\'s new marijuana coordinator, an office within the executive branch, signed on to the plan, saying it can\'t hurt even if it doesn\'t work.\r\n\r\n\"It\'s the next logical step forward,\" Andrew Freedman said.\r\n\r\nBut lawmakers weren\'t persuaded.\r\n\r\n\"It seems like we\'re throwing spaghetti noodles against the wall to see if they stick,\" said Rep.

Businesses associated with the multi-million dollar marijuana industry in Colorado - where the sale of the drug for recreational use is permitted since the beginning of the year - are still without a place to store their money. After negotiations late on Thursday, members of the House Finance Committee decided to veto a proposal that would create the first banking system to the sellers of the substance, which, only in the first month after the release of sales in January, earned $14 million.\r\n\r\nThe measure would create a kind of financial cooperative, exclusive to stores licensed to sell the drug. The system, however, would have no guarantee of the Federal Reserve (Fed, the U.S. central bank) to offer banking services such as checks and credit cards.\r\n\r\nThe bill survived for less than 24 hours after being introduced on Wednesday and was vetoed by House Finance Committee under the justification that it was necessary to better assess the issue. However, as explained by the Denver Post, House Appropriations restored the original version Friday morning and sent the measure to a vote on the House floor.\r\n\r\n\"Let\'s take some time to have this properly vetted,\" admitted the Republican Kevin Priola, who introduced the amendment calling for a reassessment.\r\n\r\nThe marijuana industry in Colorado, which already allowed the sale of the drug for medical use, has had difficulty accessing the banking system, because the substance is considered illegal by federal law. In February, the Departments of Justice and Treasury issued a statement suggesting that banks could offer basic services to the sector. At the time, the statement cited, among other benefits, the ease of overseeing a business that is currently based only on cash. Even so, financial institutions remain resistant.\r\n\r\nTo representatives of the banking sector of the state, the proposal for Colorado pot co-ops was doomed to failure, NPR said. The idea had been presented two years ago, when only the medicinal use was permitted, but was not approved.\r\n\r\n\"We really do not believe that that will work,\" said Don Childers, president of the Colorado Bankers Association.\r\n\r\nFor now, Colorado pot co-ops still needs a vote of approval from the Federal Reserve Bank in order to access the national banking system. But as the Denver Post report explained, such measures aren\'t expected to be granted.\r\n\r\nWhat\'s your opinion on the Colorado pot co-ops? Should the banks cooperate with Colorado\'s booming pot industry?'

And in doing so, it gets the best possible thing for the eagles. We’re actually able to get conservation, and hopefully in the long run, prevent that nest from begin disturbed at all by that activity.\" Stuber said.\r\n\r\nStuber said Fish and Wildlife originally wanted to grant five-year permit but the wind industry pushed for an extended period for more continuity. He said the 30-year permit requires regulators to anticipate problems ahead of time.\r\n\r\n“Before we issue a permit, since it’s a lot longer time frame, we need to try to foresee more possible situations and have a better, what we call, adaptive management plan as a part of these permits. That way, when we come in for the five-year check-in, we have things on paper of what we’ll do to respond to certain situations,” he added. \r\n\r\nWind farms are clusters of turbines as tall as 30-story buildings, with spinning rotors as wide as a passenger jet\'s wingspan. Though the blades appear to move slowly, they can reach speeds of up to 170 mph at the tips, creating tornado-like vortexes.\r\n\r\nAccording to federal biologists, wind farms in 10 states have killed at least 85 eagles since 1997, with most deaths occurring between 2008 and 2012, as the industry was greatly expanding. Most deaths — 79 — were golden eagles that struck wind turbines. One of the eagles counted in the study was electrocuted by a power line.\r\n\r\nWind farms in two states, California and Wyoming, were responsible for 58 deaths, followed by facilities in Oregon, New Mexico, Colorado, Washington, Utah, Texas, Maryland and Iowa.\r\n\r\nHutchins told NPR that the American Bird Conservancy is not against wind energy, but simply wants wind farms to be ordered not disturb or kill eagles. \r\n\r\n“It’s just a really big price to pay. I don’t think that we can see these resources as collateral damage to try to win the fight on climate change,” Hutchins said.'
16b.txt,'title: Bird conservation group to challenge rule allowing wind farms to kill eagles\r\n\r\nThe American Bird Conservancy has announced its intention to file suit against the Department of Interior for promulgating a regulation that authorizes the granting of 30-year permits for the taking of eagles by wind farms and electricity transmission projects.  Here is ABC’s release and notice of intent to sue.\r\n\r\nUnder federal law, it is illegal to “take” protected species unless one obtains an “incidental take permit” from the federal government.  The Interior Department rule, finalized in December, extends the maximum time period for which such permits can be granted from 5 to 30 years.  ABC calls the regulation the “FWS 30-year Eagle Kill Rule.” ABC claims the rule lacks a sufficient scientific foundation and that Interior failed to comply with applicable environmental statutes in promulgating the rule.  From the NOI letter:\r\n\r\n    this major rule change – which will apply to industrial activities of all kinds that incidentally take eagles but, as acknowledged by the Service, was promulgated specifically to respond to the wind power industry’s desire to facilitate the expansion of wind power projects in occupied eagle habitat, id. at 73709 – was adopted in violation of several federal wildlife protection and environmental laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 4321-437 (“NEPA”), the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. §§ 1531-1544 (“ESA”), and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, 16 U.S.C. §§ 668-668d (“BGEPA”). Consequently, ABC is initiating legal action in order to have the rule invalidated pending full compliance with federal statutes that are designed to ensure that the environmental impacts of, and alternatives to, agency actions are thoroughly analyzed before those actions are implemented.\r\n\r\n    ABC strongly supports wind power and other renewable energy projects when those projects are located in an appropriate, wildlife-friendly manner and when the impacts on birds and other wildlife have been conscientiously considered and addressed before irreversible actions are undertaken. On the other hand, when decisions regarding such projects are made precipitously and without compliance with elementary legal safeguards designed to ensure that our nation’s invaluable trust resources are not placed at risk, ABC will take appropriate action to protect eagles and other migratory birds. The 30-year eagle permit rule – adopted in the absence of any NEPA document or any consultation under section 7 of the ESA, 16 U.S.C. § 1536, and in a manner that subverts the fundamental eagle protection purpose of BGEPA – is a glaring example of an agency action that gambles recklessly with the fate of the nation’s bald and golden eagle populations.'

Over New Eagle Kill Rule\r\n\r\nWashington, D.C.-based American Bird Conservancy (ABC) has announced its intention to sue the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), charging the agency with multiple violations of federal law in connection with its recent decision to offer wind energy companies and others to obtain 30-year eagle take permits. The previous rule provided for a maximum duration of five years for each permit, which authorizes projects to \"take\" (i.e., injure, kill or otherwise disturb) eagles.\r\n\r\nOn April 30, ABC sent the DOI and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) a notice of intent to sue, and the group has chosen public interest law firm Meyer Glitzenstein & Crystal to represent it. ABC argues that the new eagle take rule violates the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (BGEPA).\r\n\r\nABC says it is initiating legal action in order to have the rule invalidated pending full compliance with federal environmental statutes. For example, the group charges that the 30-year eagle permit rule was adopted in the absence of any NEPA document or any ESA consultation regarding impacts. It is, therefore, a “glaring example of an agency action that gambles recklessly with the fate of the nation’s bald and golden eagle populations,” the letter says.\r\n\r\nMichael Hutchins, national coordinator of ABC\'s Bird Smart Wind Energy Campaign, says, \"Bald eagle populations may be technically recovered, but their popularity and symbolic importance to our nation suggests that the American people are not going to tolerate the deaths of many.\r\n\r\n\"Golden eagles are another matter,” Hutchins continues. “Much more needs to be known about their status before the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service can safely decide how many wind energy companies can kill with no net loss to the population.\"\r\n\r\nABC contends that it “strongly” supports wind power, but only when the projects “are located in an appropriate, wildlife-friendly manner and when the impacts on birds and other wildlife have been conscientiously considered and addressed before irreversible actions are undertaken.”\r\n\r\nThe group recently joined forces with Ohio-based Black Swamp Bird Observatory to successfully halt a one-turbine project planned by the Ohio National Guard.

17a.txt,'title: Liar! Liar! African bird uses elaborate ruse to steal food\r\n\r\nIf you believe honesty is the best policy, you would have a hard time convincing the forked-tailed drongo. This tricky African bird is the pathological liar of the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\nScientists described on Thursday how this medium-sized bird brazenly deceives other animals by mimicking alarm calls made by numerous bird species - and even meerkats - to warn of an approaching predator in a ruse to frighten them off and steal food they leave behind.\r\n\r\nThe researchers tracked 64 forked-tailed drongos over a span of nearly 850 hours in the Kalahari Desert in South Africa close to the Botswana border to unravel this unique behavior.\r\n\r\n\"They\'re rather demonic little black birds with red eyes, a hooked beak and a forked tail,\" said evolutionary biologist Tom Flower of the University of Cape Town in South Africa.\r\n\r\n\"They\'re also highly aggressive and are renowned for attacking eagles and hawks, for which they apparently have no fear,\" added Flower, whose study appears in the journal Science.\r\n\r\nThese birds, common in southern Africa, usually get meals the honest way, such as capturing insects in mid-air using their superb aerial skills.\r\n\r\nBut at other times, like on cold mornings when few insects are flitting around, the drongos turn to a life of crime.\r\n\r\nFALSE ALARM\r\n\r\nThe drongos are able to mimic the sounds made by many different species that inhabit its desert environment, including birds such as pied babblers, glossy starlings, sociable weavers and pale chanting goshawks as well as mammals like meerkats.\r\n\r\nThe drongos carry out an elaborate con. They give their own genuine alarm call when they spot a predator approaching - essentially behaving as sentries - and other animals come to trust that this call signals real danger.\r\n\r\nBut they sometimes give this alarm call when no danger exists to fool other animals into fleeing and abandoning their food.\r\n\r\nThen the drongos swoop down for a free lunch.\r\n\r\n\"All the animals in the Kalahari eavesdrop on each other\'s alarm calls, which provide invaluable information about potential predators. It\'s a bit of an information superhighway where all the animals speak each other\'s language,\" Flower said.\r\n\r\n\"Because drongos give reliable predator information some of the time, it maintains host responsiveness (of other animals) since they can never know if the drongo is lying or telling the truth,\" added Amanda Ridley, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Western Australia, another of the researchers.\r\n\r\nThe scientists noticed that sometimes the other animals \"get wise\" to the con and ignore repeated false alarm calls. But then the wily drongos simply grab another tool from their toolbox of trickery - they mimic the alarm calls made by other animals, once again conning them into fleeing and leaving their chow behind.\r\n\r\nFlower observed drongos mimicking more than 50 calls.\r\n\r\nWhen stealing food from other animals, drongos are able to eat larger prey than they normally would be able to capture on their own like scorpions, beetle larvae and even geckos.\r\n\r\n\"Crime pays,\" Flower said, noting that the stolen stuff accounted for about a quarter of the food eaten by the drongos.\r\n\r\n\"One could argue that the strategy of the drongo to steal food from others seems very dishonorable in human standards. But, yes, if it has found such a crafty way to catch food, which is usually much larger than the food items it catches itself, then we cannot help but admire this clever little bird\'s adaptiveness,\" Ridley added.\r\n\r\nThe researchers classify the drongo as \"a kleptoparasite.\"\r\n\r\nThere are many examples of mimicry and deception in the animal kingdom. About 20 percent of song birds mimic the calls of other birds, Flower noted.\r\n\r\n\"However, drongos are the only ones to flexibly produce the specific signals that best deceive their different hosts and to maintain their deception racket by changing signal when the previous signal failed,\" Flower added.'

When a drongo notices a predator approaching, they give an alarm call, and the babblers and meerkats can avoid predation just like they do when they hear own species\' alarm calls. In fact, babblers and meerkats have been seen acting a bit more relaxed when there are drongos around, focusing more on foraging and less on remaining vigilant, knowing that the drongo will help.\r\n\r\nThe drongos take advantage. Sometimes, when a babbler or a meerkat finds a particularly tasty looking piece of food, a drongo lies by producing a false alarm call. When that happens, the meerkat drops the food and flees to find cover, leaving the drongo to steal the food, the meerkat none the wiser.\r\n\r\nThe problem, in Aesop\'s famous story, is that the villagers eventually catch on to the boy who cried wolf, and learn to ignore his alarm calls. How does the drongo avoid the boy\'s mistake? \r\n\r\nAccording to the most basic theories of animal communication, lies are only effective if the deception occurs relatively infrequently. A few lies in a field of truths is sustainable, but if deception becomes too frequent, then the target (the meerkat or babbler, in this case) will catch on. As with many aspects of the co-evolution of signalers and receivers in biology, the best analogy is an arms race. Each species must try to out-think the other in order to retain the upper hand.\r\n\r\nAt present, the drongo is winning the arms race, because they\'ve found a way to lie a bunch but not get caught. They do it by stacking lies upon other lies. Rather than just giving false alarm calls, they mimic the alarm calls of other species. It\'s a double lie! Of 51 different alarm calls recorded from drongos, six are specific to their own species, and 45 mimic the ones of other species.\r\n\r\nTo understand more about how the drongo manages this feat, researchers Tom P. Flower, Matthew Gribble, and Amanda R. Ridley set out for the Africa\'s Kalahari Desert. The first thing they did was conduct a playback experiment on the pied babblers.\r\n\r\nThe researchers found that the babblers were slower to resume foraging after abandoning their food when they heard a recording of a drongo mimicking their own species\' alarm call than when they heard drongo-specific alarm calls. That explains why the drongos have learned to mimic rather than just producing their own false alarm calls\r\n\r\nIn a second experiment, the researchers played a series of three alarm calls to the babblers. If the calls were all identical (all mimics or all drongo-specific), the babblers habituated. In other words, they began to realize that the caller was \"crying wolf.\" But if there was some variation, the babblers were more likely to play it safe by seeking cover and abandoning their food. \r\n\r\nTogether, that provided Flower, Gribble, and Ridley with two different ideas for how the drongos managed to remain such successful thieves. Next, they went to see whether the drongos actually used those two strategies.\r\n\r\nAnd they did. The drongos were more likely to mimic the alarm calls of the species they were targeting than any of their other false alarm calls. Wild drongos also changed their call type around 75 percent of the time, especially after a failed attempt. And not only that, they wound up being more successful in snatching a decent meal after switching to a second call type, if the first try failed. It shows that not only are they able to deceive, but that they explicitly modulate their deception by paying attention to the responses of their targets.\r\n\r\nSo the drongo really is the bird that cried wolf, but it remains successful by crying wolf in lots of different ways.\r\n\r\nTactical deception such as this is traditionally thought of as an ability associated with cognitive sophistication and basic theory of mind, something not usually attributed to songbirds. While further research is needed to see just how sophisticated the fork-tailed drongo is, the thirty million years of evolution that separates fork-tailed drongos (Dicruridae) from the brainiest of birds, crows, ravens, and jays (Corvidae), underscores the fact that similar behaviors in different species are not necessarily the same, but can rely upon different evolved mechanisms according to each species\' ecology. The corvids might have theory of mind, while a similar observable behavior may have evolved in drongos due to simpler associative learning. Or, it must be said, the opposite could be true. The only species for which we can say with complete certainty has theory of mind is our own.\r\n\r\nA mind does not develop in a vacuum, but in a very specific environment, with unique social and physical constraints. \"Determining what different mechanisms enable the production of complex behavior and when these are selectively advantageous,\" writes Flower, \"remain key questions in evolutionary biology.\"\r\n'
17c.txt,'title: Sly birds cleverly \'cry wolf\' to steal food from other animals\r\n\r\nThe African fork-tailed drongo can mimic over 30 different calls of other species in an effort to distract animals. If one call doesn\'t work, they simply try another one. \r\n\r\nThe red-eyed, black-feathered fork-tailed drongo is an irrepressible mimic, capable of reproducing the calls of everything from other birds to mongoose-like meerkats. Now, a new study finds that these drongo birds are strategic copycats: They \"cry wolf\" about potential danger, startling other animals and stealing their food.\r\n \r\nWhat\'s more, drongos (Dicrurus adsimilis) alter their cries to keep their targets from becoming inured to the trick.\r\n \r\nThis ability to change up calls when one of the calls isn\'t working may be an evolutionary way to get around the problem the little boy in Aesop\'s fable ran into: If you raise the alarm about danger too many times, eventually, no one listens. The problem plagues any animal that uses a deceptive strategy, said study researcher Tom Flower, a behavioral ecologist at the Percy FitzPatrick Institute of African Ornithology.\r\n \r\n\"Drongos, by varying the type of alarm call they make when they\'re making repeated food-theft attempts, actually maintain the deception,\" Flower told LiveScience.\r\n\r\nFalse alarms\r\nFlower studied drongos in the Kalahari Desert of South Africa. At the desert\'s Kuruman River Reserve — where the popular Animal Planet show \"Meerkat Manor\" was filmed — animals are habituated to human presence. They\'re also tagged with specks of dye (for meerkats) or ankle bands (for birds). This allows researchers to make close observations of specific individuals.\r\n \r\nAt the site, Flower said he \"spent a long time walking around with the meerkats, and the drongos commonly came over and joined us.\" He noticed the birds treated the meerkats like living \"plows.\" As the meerkats dug up dirt, the drongos would trail the mammals, catching bugs churned up by their paws.\r\n \r\nIntriguingly, when a meerkat came across a particularly delicious snack, such as a scorpion or fat larva, the drongos would sometimes let loose with an alarm call. Sometimes the call would mimic that of the meerkat or another species, and sometimes it would be a drongo cry. This would typically spook the meerkat, making it drop the tasty morsel and retreat, at which point the drongo was free to swoop in for a free meal.\r\n\r\nDrongo deception\r\nTo understand this behavior, as well as the dazzling array of alarm calls drongos can mimic (Flower recorded one individual with a range of 32 different calls), Flower and his team recorded 688 food-theft attempts over almost 850 hours of observations. The scientists found the drongos did tailor their calls, generally mimicking the alarm call of the animal they were trying to trick.\r\n \r\nNext, the researchers played recorded drongo calls for captive southern pied babblers (Turdoides bicolor), white-and-brown birds frequently targeted by drongo deception. Two calls were drongo calls; one was a drongo mimicking a pied babbler alarm call, and one was a drongo mimicking a starling alarm call.\r\n \r\nThe pied babblers responded more strongly to fake starling and pied babbler calls than to drongo alarm calls, suggesting that taking on the voices of others benefits the drongos. In a follow-up experiment, the researchers again played various drongo calls to pied babblers. This time, they either played the same calls three times in a row or played two of the same calls followed by a third, different call.\r\n \r\nSure enough, the pied babblers began ignoring repeated alarms of the same sort, seeming to realize that the caller was crying wolf. When the call switched, though, the birds continued to fall for the trick.\r\n \r\nSmart strategy\r\nIn the wild, Flower found, drongos use this switch-\'em-up strategy. He observed 151 occasions of repeated food theft by 42 drongos, and found the birds switched up their calls about 75 percent of the time. They were even more likely to do so if the previous theft attempt had failed, Flower and his colleagues reported on May 1 in the journal Science.\r\n \r\n\"They actually attend to feedback from their listeners\' behavior and adjust their alarm calls accordingly,\" Flower said. [The 5 Smartest Non-Primates on the Planet]\r\n \r\nThis talent may seem eerily clever, and it\'s possible it indicates drongos have a talent known as theory of mind, or the ability to understand what others might be thinking. But although the question of whether animals have such a theory of mind is a hot one, Flower said drongos don\'t need to know what their targets are thinking.\r\n \r\n\"It could be a really simple rule of thumb,\" he said. The birds might simply use what works: If a call succeeds, they repeat it. If it doesn\'t, they switch it up.\r\n \r\nThe fact that a learned behavior, rather than humanlike cognition, might be behind the ability does not make it less exciting, Flower said.\r\n \r\n\"What it says is that you can accomplish incredibly sophisticated behaviors through simple mechanisms,\" he said. \"And that begs the question, \'What is the evolutionary benefit to more complicated mechanisms like theory of mind?\'\"\r\n \r\nAnswering that question, he said, might explain what makes humans (and chimpanzees) so unusual in their abilities to understand others.'
17d.txt,'title: African Bird Uses False Calls to Deceive and Steal, Study Shows\r\n\r\nWhile the call of the drongo bird is usually used by meerkats and starlings as a warning of danger - the drongo makes these calls with another purpose in mind - to steal the dinner of its listeners.\r\n\r\nResearchers have found that the drongos sometimes make false alarm calls - causing their listeners to drop their dinner and flee the scene, according to National Geographic.\r\n\r\nThe birds then swoop in and make off with their victim\'s meal. \r\n\r\nThe birds are notorious among wildlife observers for their thieving ways - however, sometimes it fails - much like the fable, \'the boy who cried wolf\'. \r\n\r\nResearchers report in Science that when that happens, the sneaky birds deploy another trick: They imitate their victim\'s alarm call or that of another species.\r\n\r\nThe discovery reveals that drongos are attentive to the responses of their target.\r\n\r\n\"It\'s a really cool study,\" John Marzluff, a wildlife biologist at the University of Washington in Seattle, told National Geographic.\r\n\r\n\"It\'s the most sophisticated example of vocal deception, outside of my own species, that I\'ve ever seen.\"\r\n\r\nThe birds could be employing a type of sophisticated cognition that researchers usually reserve for humans only, writes National Geographic.\r\n\r\nTom Flower, an evolutionary biologist at South Africa\'s University of Cape Town, studied the birds\' habits by habituating and banding about 200 of the birds in the Kalahari Desert.\r\n\r\nDrongos perch high up on tree limbs - meaning they have an advantage when it comes to spotting danger - and meerkats and other creatures have learned to pay attention to their calls.\r\n\r\nThe animals listen out for the drongos call - racing for cover if the drongo warns of danger.\r\n\r\n\"They generally react the same way to a drongo\'s alarm call as they do to the alarm call of a member of their own species,\" Flower told National Geographic.\r\n\r\nScientists say the drongo\'s call is beneficial to eavesdroppers: Because they don\'t have to spend as much time looking out for predators, they have more time to forage, writes National Geographic.\r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes the drongos\' alarms are false.\r\n\r\nDrongos get as much as 23 percent of their daily food by making false alarms and then stealing the meals of their targets.\r\n\r\nWhile the drongo can usually trick its target with its own call - the target stops responding if it happens too often. \r\n\r\nThis is when the bird tries another tactic - vocal mimicry, writes National Geographic.\r\n\r\nFlower discovered the drongos have a store of alarm calls of numerous species, including birds and mammals. \r\n\r\nSome of those species make a variety of warning calls - as do the drongos-giving them a total of 51 different alarm calls.\r\n\r\nThe birds are able to \"cry wolf for longer periods than if they simply repeated the same alarm call,\" Dorothy Cheney, primatologist at the University of Pennsylvania, told National Geographic.\r\n\r\nFlower doesn\'t know what the birds are thinking as they switch among their manipulative calls, but he doubts that they\'re changing calls intentionally, writes National Geographic.\r\n\r\n\"They\'re paying attention to their targets, and they change what they\'re doing based on the feedback they receive,\" he says.\r\n\r\nOverall, the study adds to the \"mounting evidence that animals have a lot more linguistic and cognitive capabilities than they\'re usually given credit for,\" Con Slobodchikoff, animal behaviorist and emeritus professor at Northern Arizona University, in Flagstaff told National Geographic.\r\n'
17e.txt,'title: African Bird Uses Sound Effects to Bamboozle Other Species\r\n\r\nYou can\'t fool all of the species all of the time. Or can you? Biologists have found a bird in Africa that does an amazingly good job of fooling other species, time and time again, by varying the pattern of its impersonations.\r\n\r\nThe fork-tailed drongo of the Kalahari Desert is a master of deception: It can mimic not only the distress calls of other bird species, but the alarms sounded by meerkats as well. Why does the drongo do it? The mimicry tricks the other species into abandoning their food, giving the drongo an opportunity to steal it. It\'s as if a dog could yell \"Fire!\" in a crowded restaurant and then feast on whatever the fleeing humans left behind.\r\n\r\nListen to these audio examples:\r\n\r\n    Here\'s what a pied babbler sounds like when it spots a predator — in this case, a hawk. And here\'s what a drongo sounds like when it imitates a pied babbler in trouble.\r\n    Here\'s the distress call that a glossy starling makes when it sees a hawk. And here\'s what a drongo sounds like when it\'s imitating a glossy starling\'s distress call.\r\n    Here\'s how a meerkat sounds when it sees a martial eagle and raises the alarm. And here\'s the drongo\'s imitation of that meerkat alarm.\r\n\r\nNot bad, right? These are just some of the sounds that the University of Cape Town ornithologist Tom Flower collected over the course of 847 hours of observations in South Africa\'s Kuruman River Reserve, part of the Kalahari Desert.\r\n\r\nFlower trudged up to 10 miles (15 kilometers) a day, six days a week for six months out of every year since 2008 to study the drongo\'s wiles. \"I dread to think how many sand dunes I\'ve climbed, but it was worth it to get the data I needed,\" Flower said in a news release.\r\n\r\nHow drongos do it\r\n\r\nFor a research paper published this week in the journal Science, Flower and his colleagues tracked 688 attempts by 64 drongos to steal food from their neighbors of other species.\r\n\r\nSometimes the birds would sound the interspecies alarm when there was an actual threat, but they\'d also fake the alarm call if they saw that their target had a nice-looking meal in front of them. Collectively, the birds used six of their own drongo-specific alarm calls, plus another 45 calls that mimicked alarms used by other species.\r\n\r\nWhy do the drongos bother with so much mimicry? Why not stick with just one kind of deception? The researchers hypothesized that mixing up the alarms keeps their marks from wising up to the scam. The data supported that hypothesis.\r\n\r\n\"Drongos were more likely to change the type of false alarm call when their previous food-theft attempt failed,\" the researchers report. \"Furthermore, when drongos changed their false-alarm type after a failed food-theft attempt, they were more likely to successfully steal food than when they made the same alarm call.\"\r\n\r\nFlower and his teammates were impressed by the depth of the drongos\' craftiness — both the fact that the birds mixed honest and deceptive cross-species warnings, and the fact that they literally changed their tune if a tried-and-true trick no longer worked.\r\n\r\nJust how smart are they?\r\n\r\nThose strategies, known as tactical deception, \"are considered evidence that species possess cognitive abilities, including mental state attribution, akin to theory of mind,\" the researchers wrote. However, Flower told NBC News he\'s doubtful that the drongos possess that high a level of cognition.\r\n\r\n\"Instead, animals may produce such behavior using more simple mechanisms, such as associative learning,\" he said in an email. \"The key thing is therefore to determine how animals produce these behaviors. Rather than sounding like a killjoy, I actually think it\'s amazing that animals such as drongos might accomplish such sophisticated behavior using simple mechanisms. This raises the question of exactly what evolutionary benefits humans additionally gain from complex abilities like theory of mind.\"\r\n\r\nHere\'s more from Flower, in an edited Q&A format:\r\n\r\nNBC News: Is it surprising that a bird can mimic a meerkat?\r\n\r\nFlower: \"The master of mimicry is the lyrebird. Lots of parrots and mynahs mimic humans, so mammal mimicry isn\'t uncommon. The reason drongos are special is that we don\'t know why most species mimic vocalizations, while drongos use mimicry to improve their deception payoffs.\"\r\n\r\nQ: You say these cases represent key questions in evolutionary biology. Could you expand on that?\r\n\r\nA: \"For a long time, evolutionary biologists puzzled over how communication could evolve and be stable, because signalers should lie to get as much as they can, while listeners/receivers should ignore liars. The outcome is that signals are honest on average, so it pays for the receiver to respond to them. This constrains deception, because just like in Aesop\'s Fable, \'The Boy Who Cried Wolf,\' if you lie too often, animals ignore you. However, drongos evade this universal constraint on deception because when their target species learns to ignore one false alarm call type, drongos employ vocal mimicry to change the alarm call and thereby resume their food theft. They should be able to hold out for as long as their alarm repertoire lasts. The largest repertoire of any single drongo was 32 alarm calls, way more than they need to use in one day when following a group of animals.\"\r\n\r\nQ: How was it to spend hundreds of hours with thieving drongos? Did they try to fake you out? And by the way, what kind of food do they tend to steal?\r\n\r\nA: \"Hard work! ... The drongos do go for humans. If they see me with worms, they shriek at me, too. My 2-year-old was feeding them worms one day, and one made an alarm and dived at her. She dropped the worm and dashed to me, so sure enough they\'ll steal from humans!\"'
18a.txt,'title: MERS makes first U.S. appearance, in Indiana\r\n\r\nThe first U.S. case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus has been reported in Indiana, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday.\r\n\r\nThe patient is a health-care provider who recently traveled to Saudi Arabia to provide health care, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, assistant surgeon general with the U.S. Public Health Service and director for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.\r\n\r\nThe person, an American male, traveled on April 24 from Riyadh to London, then to Chicago, and took a bus to Indiana, officials said. He began experiencing shortness of breath, coughing, and fever on April 27, according to the Indiana State Department of Health.\r\n\r\nThe patient was admitted to Community Hospital in Munster, Indiana, on April 28, the same day he visited the emergency department there, the health department said. He has been isolated and is in stable condition. He is receiving oxygen support, but does not require a ventilator, Schuchat said.\r\n\r\nThe virus poses a \"very low risk to the broader general public,\" Schuchat said, as it has not been shown to spread easily from person to person.\r\n\r\nThe CDC and the Indiana State Department of Health are conducting a joint investigation into the case, according to a CDC statement. The CDC confirmed Indiana test results on Friday.\r\n\r\n\"The CDC, IDPH (Illinois Department of Public Health) and CDPH (Chicago Department of Public Health) do not consider passengers on the flight or bus to be close contacts of the patient and therefore are not at high risk,\" said Dr. LaMar Hasbrouck, director of the IDPH.\r\n\r\nPassengers on the same plane and bus as the patient will be contacted by the CDC as a precautionary measure, starting Saturday, the Illinois statement said. If the CDC identifies ill individuals with possible MERS-CoV, it will notify health officials in Chicago and Indiana.\r\n\r\n\"There is no reason to suspect any current risk to travelers or employees at O\'Hare Airport at this time,\" said CDPH commissioner Bechara Choucair.\r\n\r\nThe coronavirus, known as MERS-CoV, was first reported in the Middle East -- specifically, the Arabian Peninsula -- in 2012.\r\n\r\nLaboratory testing has confirmed 262 cases of the coronavirus in 12 countries, including the Indiana case, Schuchat said. Ninety-three people have died.\r\n\r\nSo far, all MERS cases have been linked to six countries on or near the Arabian Peninsula, Schuchat said.\r\n\r\nThe Saudi Ministry of Health has reported 339 cases, and said nearly a third of those have died. Not all of the Saudi cases have been confirmed by the World Health Organization.\r\n\r\n\"The MERS virus is of grave concern because of the virulence,\" Schuchat said. But, she added, \"We\'re not yet aware of confirmed sustained community transmission.\"\r\n\r\nLate last month, Saudi officials noted a spike in new cases.\r\n\r\nThe CDC has expected MERS to come to the United States, Schuchat said. \"We have been preparing for this.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, \"The introduction of MERS-CoV is another reminder that diseases are just a plane ride away,\" she said.\r\n\r\nOpinion: Why MERS virus is so scary\r\n\r\nMERS-CoV comes from the same group of viruses as the common cold and attacks the respiratory system, according to the CDC. Symptoms, which include fever, cough and shortness of breath, can lead to pneumonia and kidney failure.\r\n\r\nThe CDC has issued general precautions such as frequent hand-washing, avoiding close contact with infected people, avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands, and disinfecting surfaces that are frequently touched.\r\n\r\nPediatricians should ask about where young patients with high fever and respiratory symptoms have traveled, Schuchat said.\r\n\r\n\"Young children often have fever and respiratory symptoms, but the key here is: Was there a history of travel within the past 14 days to the Arabian Peninsula, or contact with someone? ... They should alert their clinician about that travel or contact,\" Schuchat said.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the CDC does not recommend changing travel plans because of the virus, Schuchat said.\r\n\r\nNo one knows exactly how this virus originated, but evidence is emerging implicating camels. In a recently published study in mBio, researchers said they isolated live MERS virus from two single-humped camels, known as dromedaries. They found multiple substrains in the camel viruses, including one that perfectly matches a substrain isolated from a human patient.\r\n\r\nThe same group of researchers reported in February that nearly three-quarters of camels in Saudi Arabia tested positive for past exposure to the MERS coronavirus.\r\n\r\nMERS mystery: Virus found in camels\r\n\r\nAlthough many of the cases have occurred on the Arabian Peninsula, people have died of the infection elsewhere, including in European countries and Tunisia in North Africa. Egypt reported its first case on April 26, according to the WHO.\r\n\r\nLimited human-to-human transmission of the disease has also occurred in other countries -- meaning some people who traveled to the Middle East gave the virus to others.\r\n\r\nOfficials are not aware of any other confirmed U.S. cases, Schuchat said, adding it\'s too early to assume no one else is ill. An active investigation is underway.'
18b.txt,'title: CDC Confirms First Case of MERS in US\r\n\r\n Health officials on Friday confirmed the first case of an American infected with a mysterious Middle East virus. The man fell ill after arriving in the U.S. last week from Saudi Arabia where he was a health care worker.\r\n\r\nThe man is hospitalized in stable condition in northwest Indiana with Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is investigating the case along with Indiana health officials.\r\n\r\nThe virus is not highly contagious and this case \"represents a very low risk to the broader, general public,\" Dr. Anne Schuchat told reporters during a CDC briefing.\r\n\r\nThe federal agency plans to track down passengers he may have been in close contact with during his travels; it was not clear how many people may have been exposed to the virus.\r\n\r\nOfficials didn\'t provide any details about the man\'s job in Saudi Arabia or whether he was treating MERS patients there. Saudi Arabia has been the center of a MERS outbreak that began two years ago, and infections have been reported in health care workers.\r\n\r\nOverall, at least 400 people have had the respiratory illness, and more than 100 people have died. All had ties to the Middle East or to people who traveled there.\r\n\r\nMERS belongs to the coronavirus family that includes the common cold and SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which caused some 800 deaths globally in 2003.\r\n\r\nThe MERS virus has been found in camels, but officials don\'t know how it is spreading to humans. It can spread from person to person, but officials believe that happens only after close contact. Not all those exposed to the virus become ill.\r\n\r\nBut it appears to be unusually lethal — by some estimates, it has killed nearly a third of the people it sickened. That\'s a far higher percentage than seasonal flu or other routine infections. But it is not as contagious as flu, measles or other diseases. There is no vaccine or cure for MERS.\r\n\r\nFederal and state health officials on Friday released only limited information about the U.S. case: On April 24, the man flew from Riyadh — Saudi Arabia\'s capital and largest city — to the United States, with a stop in London. He landed in Chicago and took a bus to the neighboring state of Indiana. He didn\'t become sick until Sunday, the CDC said.\r\n\r\nHe went to the emergency room at Community Hospital in Munster the next day with a fever, cough and shortness of breath. He was admitted and tested for the MERS virus because he had traveled from the Middle East.\r\n\r\nThere\'s been a recent surge in MERS illnesses in Saudi Arabia; cases have tended to increase in the spring. Experts think the uptick may party be due to more and better surveillance. Researchers at Columbia University have an additional theory — there may be more virus circulating in the spring, when camels are born.\r\n\r\nU.S. health officials have been bracing for the arrival of one or more cases, likely among travelers. Isolated cases of MERS have been carried outside the Middle East. Previously, 163 suspected cases were tested in the U.S. but none confirmed.'
18c.txt,'title: U.S. Reports First Case of MERS\r\n\r\nThe United States has reported its first case of a new virus found in the Middle East, in a traveler from the region, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.\r\n\r\nThe patient, a healthcare worker who traveled from Saudi Arabia to Indiana, is being kept isolated in an Indiana hospital after being diagnosed with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus, the CDC says.\r\n\r\n\"In 2014 these new diseases are just a plane ride away,\" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, assistant surgeon general and director of CDC’s National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases. “We have been preparing since 2012 for this eventuality.”\r\n\r\nThe World Health Organization has expressed alarm about the increase in reports of MERS. WHO reports more than 250 confirmed cases and 93 deaths since the virus was identified in 2012. But Saudi Arabia alone has reported 371 cases, with 107 deaths.\r\n\r\nExperts say it was only a matter of time before it came to the United States.\r\n\r\nSchuchat says this first imported case poses only a low risk for the general public. \"We don\'t have a sense right now that this is very easy to spread,\" Schuchat told reporters on a conference call.\r\n\r\nThe virus has not been known to spread on airplanes or buses. Most cases have been among people caring for sick patients or in very close contact with them.\r\n\r\nThe CDC says it is tracking down anyone who might have been in contact with the patient, including airplane seat mates, out of an abundance of caution. They\'re also checking health care workers who cared for him.\r\n\r\n“On April 24, the patient traveled by plane from Saudi Arabia to London, then from London to Chicago,” the CDC said. “The patient then took a bus from Chicago to Indiana. On the 27th, the patient began to experience signs of illness, including shortness of breath and coughing. The patient went to an emergency department on April 28th. Because of the patient’s symptoms and travel history, Indiana public health officials had him tested for MERS.”\r\n\r\nIndiana state health officials said the patient was at Community Hospital in Munster.\r\n\r\n\"In light of federal privacy regulations, we can only disclose that the patient is in good condition,\" hospital officials said in a statement. \"We are maintaining appropriate isolation protocols for the protection of health care staff.\"\r\n\r\nExposed family members and health care workers will be monitored daily throughout the 14-day incubation period for MERS, officials said. The patient wasn\'t out in the local community, so any public exposure was \"minimal,\" they added.\r\n\r\nThe virus has infected people in Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirate, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Britain, Tunisia, Malaysia and the Philippines. There’s no specific treatment, no cure and no vaccine for MERS.\r\n\r\nLast week, WHO predicted a springtime surge in MERS cases.\r\n\r\nMERS first showed up in 2012, when it killed an elderly Saudi man. It worries health experts because it’s related to severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which swept around the world in 2003, infecting around 8,000 people and killing close to 800 before it was stopped. Both conditions are caused by coronaviruses, members of a family of viruses that usually cause common cold symptoms and that infect a wide range of mammals.\r\n\r\nThe most recent research traces it to camels, although most cases seem to be spread from one person to another.\r\n\r\nThe virus can survive on surfaces, and might spread when people touch something contaminated. SARS appears to have spread that way, and many other viruses do, too.\r\n\r\nCDC and WHO say the virus has spread many times in hospitals, dialysis centers and other healthcare facilities, so they are cautioning health workers to take special precautions.\r\n\r\n“Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS in health care facilities,” WHO says.\r\n\r\n“Health care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients — regardless of their diagnosis — in all work practices all the time.”\r\n\r\nWhile MERS kills about a third of the patients who show symptoms, some people have been found later to have been infected but they never got sick. Most of those who have been severely ill have been elderly or had other illnesses such as diabetes or kidney disease.\r\n'
18d.txt,'title: First U.S. case of deadly MERS virus confirmed: CDC\r\n\r\nA healthcare worker who had traveled to Saudi Arabia was confirmed as the first U.S. case of Middle East Respiratory Virus (MERS), an often fatal illness, raising new concerns about the rapid spread of such diseases, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday.\r\n\r\nThe male patient traveled via a British Airways flight on April 24 from Riyadh to London, where he changed flights at Heathrow airport to fly to the United States. He landed in Chicago and took a bus to an undisclosed city in Indiana.\r\n\r\nOn April 27, he experienced respiratory symptoms, including fever, cough and shortness of breath. According to the Indiana State Department of Health, the man visited the emergency department at Community Hospital in Munster, Indiana, on April 28 and was admitted that same day.\r\n\r\nBecause of his travel history, Indiana health officials tested him for MERS, and sent the samples to the CDC, which confirmed the presence of the virus on Friday.\r\n\r\nThe virus is similar to the one that caused Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which emerged in China in 2002-2003 and killed some 800 people. It was first detected in Saudi Arabia in 2012.\r\n\r\nDr. Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC\'s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said on a conference call the first U.S. case of MERS was \"of great concern because of its virulence,\" proving fatal in about a third of infections.\r\n\r\nShe said the case represents \"a very low risk to the broader general public,\" but MERS has been shown to spread to healthcare workers and there are no known treatments for the virus.\r\n\r\nSchuchat said the patient was now in stable condition and there are no other suspected cases of MERS at the current time.\r\n\r\nThe CDC declined to identify the patient by name or say where he was being treated. It also declined to say on which airlines or bus line the patient traveled. Schuchat said the CDC was working with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to contact individuals who may have been exposed to the patient during his travels.\r\n\r\nIn Britain, public health officials said they were contacting any passengers who had been sitting near the patient.\r\n\r\nGreg Cunningham, a spokesman for the Chicago Department of Aviation, said that the department \"has been advised that there is no reason to suspect any risk at O\'Hare,\" Chicago\'s only international airport. \"There has only been one incident confirmed to have MERS, and he is hospitalized in Indiana,\" he said.\r\n\r\nWORKING SURVEILLANCE\r\n\r\nAlthough the vast majority of MERS cases have been in Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Middle East, the discovery of sporadic cases in Britain, Greece, France, Italy, Malaysia and elsewhere have raised concerns about the potential global spread of the disease by infected airline passengers.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of the U.S. patient, 262 people in 12 countries have been confirmed to have MERS infections and have been reported to the World Health Organization. Of those, 93 have died, Schuchat said.\r\n\r\nInfectious disease specialists in the United States said that the fact the newest patient was identified quickly showed that disease surveillance was working.\r\n\r\n\"It was only a matter of time before the United States had a case,\" said virologist Dr. W. Ian Lipkin of Columbia University in New York. \"Most of us thought it was not a question of if, but when. Am I more concerned as a result of this case? No.\"\r\n\r\n\"One case does not represent a reason for panic,\" agreed Dr. Wayne Marasco, an infectious disease specialist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.\r\n\r\n\"But the very fact that we have a virus with documented person-to-person transmission at a fairly efficient rate and a high mortality rate suggests we have a potentially serious pathogen. There are no therapies out there that I\'m aware of, but I don\'t think we have a very big risk in the United States.\"\r\n\r\nMarasco suggests that immigration agents should nevertheless be on heightened alert for passengers arriving in the United States after trips to the Middle East, especially Saudi Arabia.\r\n\r\n\"They should ask, where did you travel? Have you had contact with animals, with anyone who was sick, and do you have a fever or cough?\" he said.\r\n\r\nMarasco does not believe that thermal scanners such as those China and other countries deployed during the 2003 SARS epidemic would make much of a difference. That\'s because the incubation period for MERS is two to 14 days, \"so an asymptomatic traveler could make it through a thermal scanner,\" Marasco said.\r\n\r\nMYSTERY OF TRANSMISSION\r\n\r\nThe greatest reason for concern is that so little is known about this coronavirus. It has been found in bats and camels, and many experts say camels are the most likely animal reservoir from which humans become infected.\r\n\r\nIn part, that ignorance is a result of the lack of cooperation between Middle Eastern countries, where MERS has been spreading, and scientists elsewhere. \"One of the biggest problems is that we haven\'t had any access to samples from Saudi Arabia, Jordan or Qatar despite my efforts,\" Marasco said\r\n\r\nNow that the United States has a case of MERS, there might be political pressure for that to change, suggested Lipkin, who pointed out that during the SARS epidemic, China was similarly reluctant to cooperate with western scientists.\r\n\r\n\"Now the U.S. is going to be more interested. I think it will have an impact on the number of scientists here who will be encouraged to work on MERS and congressmen will stand up and rail about the importance of this,\" Lipkin said.'
18e.txt,'title: Deadly MERS virus turns up in U.S. for first time\r\n\r\nA deadly virus from the Middle East that causes severe acute respiratory illness has turned up in Indiana in the first known case in the United States. The man fell ill after arriving in the U.S. about a week ago from Saudi Arabia, where he is a health care worker.\r\n\r\nThe virus — known as MERS, short for Middle East respiratory syndrome — first surfaced two years ago. Since then, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed cases in 401 people in 12 countries, 93 of whom have died. Saudi Arabia has been hit hardest with 322 cases and 68 deaths.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. case involves a man in Indiana who traveled to Saudi Arabia and returned to the United States through London Heathrow airport to Chicago\'s O\'Hare airport and then to Indiana by bus, the CDC says.\r\n\r\n\"This is a rapidly evolving situation,\" Assistant Surgeon General Anne Schuchat, who is also the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said at a Friday news conference. \"The introduction of MERS-CoV is another reminder that diseases are just a plane ride away.\"\r\n\r\nThe man didn\'t become ill until he arrived in Indiana. Symptoms can include fever, cough and breathing problems, which can lead to pneumonia and kidney failure. The CDC says the patient is being well cared for, is currently isolated and is in stable condition. He is being treated at Community Hospital in Munster, Ind., where he arrived Monday.\r\n\r\nThe CDC says the virus has spread from ill people to others through close contact but has not been shown to spread \"in a sustained way in communities.\" MERS belongs to the coronavirus family, which includes the common cold and SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which caused some 800 deaths globally in 2003.\r\n\r\nIan Lipkin, a professor of epidemiology at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University in New York, said his research suggests that the virus passes from camels to people, though it\'s unclear whether the virus is transmitted by drinking raw camel milk, eating raw meat or some other route. The first person known to have MERS-CoV owned four camels, he said.\r\n\r\nLipkin said the virus has been present in Middle Eastern camels since at least the 1990s, but it\'s not clear whether it has recently changed to trigger the outbreaks in people. Camels in the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., are not infected with the virus, he said.\r\n\r\nHe praised the CDC\'s handling of the case, and said the likelihood of transmission is \"very slight.\"\r\n\r\nShira Doron, an infectious disease expert and epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, said the virus is similar to the SARS virus, which caused widespread anxiety, but burned out on its own about a decade ago.\r\n\r\n\"We\'ve been ready for this since 2012,\" she said. \"Obviously, we\'ve been hoping that it doesn\'t come and SARS never did come to the U.S., but we\'ve been expecting it and been ready.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact that the seasonal flu is hanging around longer this year than usual will cut down on any transmission of MERS-CoV, Doron said. Anyone who shows up in an emergency room with a respiratory infection will immediately be given a mask and put in a private room, she said, minimizing exposure of other people in the ER.\r\n\r\nEveryone who came into contact with the Indiana patient — on the plane, aboard the bus or in the hospital — are being warned to look for acute respiratory symptoms. No one else has been confirmed to have been infected, but \"it\'s too early to breathe a sigh of relief,\" Schuchat said. She added that the virus \"represents a very low risk to the broad general public.\" State and federal public health officials are working together to alert those who may have been exposed to the patient.\r\n\r\nIndiana Gov. Mike Pence offered reassurance to state residents. \"I want to assure every Hoosier that we have deployed the full resources of the Indiana State Department of Health to engage in tracking this case, assessing the risk to the public and working together to prevent the spread of the virus.\"\r\n\r\nSince April 2012, countries with MERS-confirmed cases include France, Italy, Jordan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, the United Kingdom and United Arab Emirates.\r\n\r\nThe CDC says the virus likely came from an animal source. In addition to humans, MERS-CoV has been found in camels in Qatar and a bat in Saudi Arabia. There is no vaccine or specific treatment for this virus yet.'
19a.txt,'title: Scientists debate whether remaining smallpox virus should be destroyed\r\n\r\nMore than 30 years ago, the deadly infectious disease known as smallpox was declared eradicated by the World Health Organization (WHO).  \r\n\r\nBut in actuality, the virus isn’t gone just yet.\r\n\r\nThe last few strains of the variola virus, the pathogen that causes smallpox, are currently being held in high security labs in the United States and Russia.  According to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald, experts at WHO now must make a crucial decision later this month: Destroy the virus completely – or keep these remaining vials in stock.\r\n\r\nAlthough killing the variola vials would prevent the virus from being used as a terror-related weapon, three leading virologists argue that the stock should be kept for research purposes – in case the virus re-emerges in the future.\r\n\r\n\"There is more work to be done before the international community can be confident that it possesses sufficient protection against any future smallpox threats,\" the researchers, Dr. Inger Damon, Grant McFadden and Clarissa Damaso, wrote in an opinion piece published in the journal PLoS Pathogens.\r\n\r\nCharacterized by numerous raised bumps on an individual’s face and body, smallpox had once been one of the deadliest diseases in the world, killing approximately a third of the people it infected.   The virus was also utilized in times of warfare in the 17th and 18th centuries – as well as by the British in the American Revolutionary War.\r\n\r\nEver since worldwide vaccination efforts led to smallpox’s eradication in 1980, WHO agreed that the last viral strains would be destroyed eventually, to stop the disease from being weaponized.  But the organization never decided when that day would be, and for the past 30 years, WHO has repeatedly postponed taking this step.\r\n\r\nMany health experts believe it’s time to finally be rid of the variola virus, including Dr. D.A. Henderson, who led the WHO\'s global smallpox eradication campaign.\r\n\r\n\"Let\'s destroy the virus and be done with it,\" Henderson, who now works for the nonprofit UPMC Center for Health Security , told the Associated Press. \"We would be better off spending our money in better ways.”\r\n\r\nBut a recent WHO meeting raised a concerning point: Advances in bio-technology may make it possible to recreate the smallpox virus from scratch.\r\n\r\n“The synthetic biology adds a new wrinkle to it,\" Jimmy Kolker, assistant secretary for global affairs for U.S. Health and Human Services, told The Associated Press. \"We now aren\'t as sure that our countermeasures are going to be as effective as we\'d thought even five years ago.\"\r\n\r\nThe WHO is set to debate on this topic by the end of the month.  Meanwhile, the variola virus is being used for limited research and to create safer drugs and vaccines in case the killer virus occurs.'

19e.txt,'title: Scientists Say The Time\'s Not Right To Eliminate The Smallpox Virus\r\n\r\nThere\'s a conference coming up in which a decision is to be made on whether the last known remaining live strains of the smallpox virus should be destroyed. In anticipation of this, an international group of scientists are saying no, arguing that crucial scientific questions about the virus remain unanswered.\r\n\r\nThe status of variola, the virus that causes smallpox, is to be considered at an upcoming meeting of the World Health Assembly (WHA), the governing body of the World Health Organization. The virus was eradicated in 1980, but biologists have been performing limited studies focusing on diagnostic, antiviral vaccine development under close direction and oversight. The work is being done in two high-security labs, one in the US and one in Russia.\r\n\r\nThe fear, however, is that the virus could re-appear in the population, either by accident or deliberate release. The prospect of synthetic biology is another potential risk, where the virus could be reconstituted from its blueprints.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of these risks, a group of scientists say it\'s premature to destroy the last remnants. Writing in PLoS Pathogens, here\'s what they have to say:\r\n\r\n    Despite significant advances, there is more work to be done before the international community can be confident that it possesses sufficient protection against any future smallpox threats. The current World Health Organization (WHO)-approved research agenda for smallpox has been tightly focused by the interpretation that research \"essential for public health\" equates solely to applied research related directly to the development of new antiviral drugs, safer vaccines, and better diagnostics. Despite considerable advances in this direction, we argue that the research agenda with live variola virus is not yet finished and that significant gaps still remain.\r\n\r\n    Variola virus is unique amongst the orthopoxviruses in that it is known to be a sole human pathogen. The viral and host factors responsible for this human-specific tropism remain essentially unknown to this day, although the current genomic information across orthopoxviruses makes hypothesis-driven experimental design using functional genomic approaches more feasible. Indeed, greater exploitation of current technologies may lead to additional therapeutic or diagnostic products to better respond to any future emergency situation resulting from a smallpox appearance.\r\n\r\nLater this month, the WHA will have to make a decision: destroy the remaining stocks of live variola virus or recommend continued research with live variola virus in the two WHO-certified sites.\r\n\r\n\"This research remains vital, and we believe that the original goals of the WHO agenda for newer and safer vaccines, fully licensed antiviral drugs, and better diagnostics have still not been fully met,\" recommend the researchers.

1a.txt,'title: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar offers a different perspective on Donald Sterling\r\n\r\nIn an op-ed piece for Time magazine, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar questions whether the reaction to Donald Sterling is entirely fair.\r\n\r\nHe calls the publication of Sterling\'s private conversation with V. Stiviano \"sleazy,\" and questions why the racially charged comments attributed to him were drawing more ridicule than his well-documented history of racist acts.\r\n\r\nAbdul-Jabbar says the public is caught up in something he calls \"extreme finger wagging.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was discriminating against black and Hispanic families for years, preventing them from getting housing,\" Abdul-Jabbar writes. \"It was public record. We did nothing. Suddenly he says he doesn’t want his girlfriend posing with Magic Johnson on Instagram and we bring out the torches and rope. Shouldn’t we have all called for his resignation back then?\r\n\r\n\"Shouldn’t we be equally angered by the fact that his private, intimate conversation was taped and then leaked to the media? Didn’t we just call to task the NSA for intruding into American citizen\'s privacy in such an un-American way?\"\r\n\r\nAbdul-Jabbar says he\'s angered by Sterling\'s comments. The former Laker says Sterling is a villain in this situation -- but wonders whether he\'s the only one.\r\n\r\n\"Man, what a winding road she led him down to get all of that out,\" Abdul-Jabbar writes of Stiviano. \"She was like a sexy nanny playing \'pin the fried chicken on the Sambo.\' She blindfolded him and spun him around until he was just blathering all sorts of incoherent racist sound bites that had the news media peeing themselves with glee.\"\r\n\r\nAbdul-Jabbar goes on to say that Sterling shouldn\'t be the only one who is punished and that he hopes the bigger message doesn\'t get lost in all the noise and clamor from the media and pundits.\r\n\r\n\"The big question is \'What should be done next?\' \" Abdul-Jabbar writes. \"I hope Sterling loses his franchise. I hope whoever made this illegal tape is sent to prison. I hope the Clippers continue to be unconditionally supported by their fans. I hope the Clippers realize that the ramblings of an 80-year-old man jealous of his young girlfriend don’t define who they are as individual players or as a team. They aren’t playing for Sterling — they’re playing for themselves, for the fans, for showing the world that neither basketball, nor our American ideals, are defined by a few pathetic men or women.\r\n\r\n\"Let’s use this tawdry incident to remind ourselves of the old saying: \'Eternal vigilance is the price of freedom.\' Instead of being content to punish Sterling and go back to sleep, we need to be inspired to vigilantly seek out, expose, and eliminate racism at its first signs.\"\r\n\r\n'
1b.txt,'title: What About Donald Sterling\'s Right To Privacy?\r\n\r\nYou can\'t forget what you\'ve heard with your own ears.\r\n\r\nThanks to the widespread broadcast of his beliefs on race, the disgrace of Los Angeles Clippers owner is now cemented, and the NBA is seeking to force him to sell the team.\r\n\r\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver acknowledged as much at a news conference Tuesday, during which he announced that Sterling was banned from the league for life for his remarks on race.\r\n\r\nJovian Wei of Fox News asked, \"Should someone lose their team for remarks shared in private — is this a slippery slope?\"\r\n\r\nSilver responded, \"Whether or not these remarks were initially shared in private, they are now public, and they represent his views.\"\r\nAnd that was it, on to the next question. But should those comments have been made public to begin with?\r\n\r\nThe recordings were first posted by the gossip website TMZ, and they appeared to capture a private discussion.\r\n\r\nIn the audio, Sterling doesn\'t use any racial epithets, but what he says is just as hateful. The Clippers\' owner was beseeching his friend — a woman his wife alleges is his mistress — not to post pictures of herself with black men on Instagram or to bring them to Clippers games. The revelations prompted a public outcry, not least from many of the league\'s African-American stars.\r\n\r\nV. Stiviano is the woman at the center. The law firm representing her tells NPR she has no romantic involvement with Sterling and that he agreed that she could tape their exchanges. But it sure sounded like a conversation between intimates, which in this case is said to have taken place at the home Sterling bought for Stiviano. (TMZ said the exchange took place in April; Stiviano\'s law firm says it occurred in September.)\r\n\r\n\"When does newsworthiness trump privacy? Is nothing private anymore?\" asks broadcast journalist Al Tompkins, who teaches ethics at the Poynter Institute, a journalism school in St. Petersburg, Fla.\r\n\r\n\"Whether you\'re not at all public or you\'re the president of the United States, does this mean that everything you say is potentially reportable on TV, on radio, online? What about in your home?\" he asks.\r\n\r\nUnder California law, all parties involved have to consent to the recording of private remarks. Even bigots. If Sterling knew he was being recorded, Tompkins says, he should have known his remarks could become public. Yet, Tompkins says, journalists should think hard before publishing such private material.\r\n\r\nSuch disparate figures as the conservative commentator , author , and former Los Angeles Lakers great have questioned whether Sterling has been unfairly stripped of his privacy, no matter how offensive his remarks.\r\n\r\nNo such ethical torment for the sports gossip and news site Deadspin.\r\n\r\n\"None. None, really,\" says Deadspin editor-in-chief Tommy Craggs. \"I mean, the distinction we make is almost entirely what we find compelling or not.\"\r\n\r\nDeadspin posted its own of the Sterling audio. In it, Stiviano challenges Sterling, noting that the players on his own team are black. Sterling counters that he is paying, feeding and clothing them — an outlook that Craggs argues evokes a plantation mentality.\r\n\r\n\"This is Donald Sterling expressing a round and very ugly world view that we\'ve known about for a long time,\" Craggs says. \"This wasn\'t just off the cuff. This is what he believes.\"\r\n\r\nTMZ has not explained anything about its decision to post that audio or how it was obtained, so there are a lot of questions about its source and the legality of the recording that are hard to answer.\r\n\r\nDeadspin did pay a source Craggs would not identify, though he says Deadspin did not acquire the audio from Stiviano or her representatives.\r\n\r\nBut Craggs says Sterling\'s private remarks echo . A former NBA star-turned Clippers executive sued Sterling unsuccessfully for racial harassment. And Sterling settled a federal housing racial bias lawsuit, but did not admit wrongdoing. Black and Latino tenants accused him of racial discrimination.\r\n\r\nPoynter\'s Tompkins says that history doesn\'t erase the ethical quandary:\r\n\r\n\"We find ourselves in the uncomfortable position of saying, \'But wait a minute, doesn\'t he have the right to say what he believes [in a private moment] — no matter how reprehensible — without fear of somebody recording it and putting it online?\' \" Tompkins says, additionally asking, \"So where does this leave us?\"\r\n\r\nIt leaves us all chasing the story: the websites that posted the audio, the reporters following on their heels, and the millions upon millions of us who have clicked on their stories and turned on their programs.'
1c.txt,'title: NBA, show spine: Sterling has got to go\r\n\r\nIt\'s time for someone in the NBA to show some backbone. Donald Sterling, the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, has got to go and he has got to go in a very public fashion.\r\n\r\nListen to the audio recording that is alleged to be of his voice spewing vile reproach at his mistress about her associating with black people in public, and taking photos with black people (Magic Johnson and Matt Kemp, in particular). The audio has not been authenticated as Sterling, but he has not denied it.\r\n\r\nListen to the entire five minutes of unhinged ranting and you\'ll hear a man forbid a woman (Sterling\'s girlfriend, V. Stiviano, TMZ alleges) from bringing black people to NBA games, as well as some very strange, offensive opinions about \"black Jews\" being treated worse in Israel than \"white Jews.\"\r\nBy the way, racial discrimination issues have trailed Sterling for years, with the NBA getting red flag after red flag on this guy and doing nothing about it.\r\n\r\nThere are many questions about the legality of the recording and how TMZ got its hands on it (my money is on Stiviano, who is embroiled in legal troubles with Sterling\'s wife, is almost 60 years his junior, and also happens to be of mixed race and part black).\r\n\r\nIf the recording is proven to be Sterling, the NBA has a wide open court and one shot to shatter the glass on this dunk. Forget the short suspension paired with \"pressure\" to sell the team -- a la Marge Schott, who in 1999 was forced out as owner of baseball\'s Cincinnati Reds after making comments about blacks, Jews and gays.\r\nThe Players Association\'s demand that Sterling be barred from all playoff games this season isn\'t enough. What the players in the league deserve is for Sterling to be suspended for life and publicly--and unprecedentedly--stripped of his franchise rights.\r\n\r\nIf they merely \"suggest\" he sell the team, he\'ll just complain that he was set up by a crazy mistress and will make out like a bandit. He bought the team in 1981 for $12 million. Forbes recently put the value of the team at $575 million.\r\n\r\nWe can admonish Sterling all we want, and there has been plenty of that coming in: from LeBron James (\"I couldn\'t play for him\") to Michael Jordan (\"sickening\") to the President of the United States (\"incredibly offensive\"). But talk is cheap: It\'s time for someone to be bold.\r\n\r\nThe players have already missed the opportunity to send the NBA, its owners and its fans a powerful message. Just days after the story broke, the players, most of whom are black, had game four in the league series on Sunday night in Oakland. They showed up and they got shellacked.\r\n\r\nThey found ways to make statements of protest: turning their practice jerseys inside out, piling their warm-ups in the center court and wearing black socks in solidarity with other teams. It was noteworthy, but once again, Sterling got a pass. The players would have done the league, the country and themselves a huge favor if they had just not shown up to the game.\r\n\r\nWith the momentum of this story, and the outrage building, a boycott would have been the principled stance that the league has been missing all these years. The nation would have been 100\% behind the players. The Clippers jerseys would have been reclaimed by the players as a symbol of power, rather than a reminder of its racist owner.\r\n\r\nBut now there will just be more talk. Should fans boycott the games? Should people not wear the jerseys? The public, the Clippers fans and the players need a way to show their support for the players and their disgust for Sterling.\r\n\r\nFor now, we wait to see what Commissioner Adam Silver and the NBA decide to do. They might as well play to win. As they say in sports, go big or go home.'
1d.txt,'title: Over four days, the Donald Sterling story led to seismic changes to Los Angeles basketball and the NBA\r\n\r\nThe Los Angeles Clippers were enjoying a rare day off, basking in the momentum from a playoff victory one night earlier and enjoying the comforts of a posh hotel near Union Square in San Francisco. There was no way to know that nearly 400 miles to the south, the team’s world was about to unravel.\r\n\r\nThe tip came into TMZ’s Marina del Rey offices, and though the gossip Web site would not identify the source, by 10 p.m. Pacific Time — 1 a.m. Saturday on the East Coast — the scoop was posted online. By time the sun rose, basketball in Los Angeles had already reached a point of no return.\r\n\r\n Clippers owner Donald Sterling’s voice had been captured on tape, a recording that included racist comments spoken to his girlfriend. TMZ posted the audio and what followed were four raucous, volatile days that demonstrated the tremendous speed with which a story can assume critical mass in this media age.\r\n\r\nThey also hinted at a burgeoning sense of power among the National Basketball Association’s millionaire players, three-quarters of whom are African American, that tested the league’s first-year commissioner, shined a spotlight on an antiquated cultural divide and could ultimately topple a controversial owner with a long history of legal wrangling over race discrimination and sexual harassment allegations.\r\n\r\nEveryone from President Obama to Snoop Dogg lined up to vilify the statements made by Sterling, 80, a billionaire real estate mogul who has owned the Clippers since 1981. He had been caught on tape scolding a girlfriend for associating with African American players, including retired NBA great Magic Johnson. “It bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you’re associating with black people,” he said, among other things.\r\n\r\nOn that first day, Sterling’s employees in the Clippers management rose to his defense.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Sterling is emphatic that what is reflected on that recording is not consistent with, nor does it reflect his views, beliefs or feelings,” Clippers President Andy Roeser said in a statement. “It is the antithesis of who he is, what he believes and how he has lived his life.”\r\n\r\nThat marked the last defensive play by the Clippers’ brass.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately, Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson, a former NBA star who’d been assisting the NBA Players Association in its search for a new executive director, sprang into action. “If the reports are true, there needs to be swift and strong action taken,” he said.\r\n\r\nLeague Commissioner Adam Silver was asleep when TMZ posted the audio and woke up to the news, the first big test of his stewardship. Silver had taken over the league’s top job less than four months earlier, and this season was the first in which the official game balls featured his signature.\r\n\r\nHe e-mailed Doug Sosnik, a former political director in the Clinton White House who specializes in crisis management and has helped the NBA navigate through choppy waters before. Silver needed help.\r\n\r\n“Anything you need,” Sosnik wrote back, according to an account in the National Journal.\r\n\r\nSilver, 52, a lanky University of Chicago-trained lawyer who’s been a league executive for more than two decades, had already spoken with Johnson, Clippers Coach Doc Rivers, Chris Paul, the team’s star guard, and also the players’ union president. He was scheduled to meet Saturday evening with reporters in Memphis prior to the Memphis Grizzlies-Oklahoma City Thunder game, but with a developing calamity on his hands, he suddenly had to be a lot more careful choosing his words. The league was still in the early stages of gathering information, Silver said, and he was exploring options available to him and hoped to find a resolution within the next few days.\r\n\r\n“All members of the NBA family should be afforded due process and a fair opportunity to present their side of any controversy,” he said, “which is why I’m not yet prepared to discuss any potential sanctions against Donald Sterling.”\r\n\r\nIn San Francisco that day, Rivers’s team was still processing the news. The Clippers ran through a practice session, and then the coach met with the media afterward at the University of San Francisco’s War Memorial Gymnasium, with NBA legend Bill Russell’s retired jersey hanging on the wall behind him. He tried to talk about basketball, but the questions centered on the growing sideshow that was elbowing its way onto center stage.\r\n\r\nNo, he hadn’t spoken with Sterling. And no, he didn’t particularly want to, either.\r\n\r\n“This is a situation where we’re trying to go after something very important to us -- something we’ve all dreamed about all of our childhoods,” Rivers said. “Donald or anyone else had nothing to do with that dream, and we\'re not going to let anything get in the way of those dreams.”\r\n\r\nOvernight, the controversy grew.\r\n\r\nPressure on NBA to respond\r\n\r\nObama, speaking to reporters during his visit to Malaysia, weighed in, condemning the recorded remarks. The pressure on the NBA to act grew stronger.\r\n\r\n“I have confidence that NBA Commissioner Adam Silver — a good man — will address this,” Obama said.\r\n\r\nAthletes, celebrities and activists weighed in, too, on Sunday, while league and union officials in New York were exploring their options. Clippers players, meanwhile, had to muster the energy to take the court against the Golden State Warriors that night wearing Sterling’s team’s logo on their chests.\r\n\r\n“They’ve been pulled in a million directions over the last 24 hours,” Rivers said.\r\n\r\nThe entire franchise was trying to reconcile the team’s mission with its owner’s character. Most, the head coach included, joined the organization aware of Sterling\'s controversial history. Rivers, who is black, signed on to the job last spring, eager to help a long-suffering franchise take a big step forward. He ignored any warning signs about the owner.\r\n\r\n“Really didn’t know a lot about that, to be honest,” he said, “and probably should have, I guess.”\r\n\r\nMany team employees banded together, more loyal to the team and co-workers than the owner, who was described as “sort of aloof,” by at least one former employee.\r\n\r\n“There wasn’t a real connection between him and the staff,” said the ex-employee. “I think the only times there was really a social gathering was at these annual ‘white parties.’ It was this big party at his place in Malibu where he’d invite Clippers staff, celebrities and friends, and everybody had to wear white. There were no exceptions to it. We all felt a little uneasy at those things. It was just a weird scene.”\r\n\r\nClippers players began discussing ways in which they could make a public statement. When they took the court Sunday night in Oakland for Game 4 of their best-of-seven series against Golden State, they removed their team-issued warm-up shirts and dropped them in a pile at center court. During the game, players wore black arm bands and black socks.\r\n\r\nSterling wasn’t in the building, but his estranged wife, Shelly, dressed in all black, was seated courtside, across from the Clippers’ bench. Silver, too, was in attendance. He had met at noon that day with Johnson, the Sacramento mayor, who outlined the players union’s concerns.\r\n\r\nThe toll of the previous 48 hours was especially evident on the court. The Warriors cruised to a 118-97 win, and the Clippers looked like they’d been tipped upside down and emptied out. Players hit the airport that night, the charter plane pointed south and the team headed toward uncertainty.\r\n\r\n“We’re going home now,” Rivers said. “And usually that would mean we’re going to our safe haven. And I don’t even know if that’s true, to be honest.”\r\n\r\n‘A defining moment’\r\n\r\nOn Monday, as most of the country returned to work, the spectacle quickly outgrew the sports world. Big name corporate sponsors began backing out of their agreements with the Clippers, sending a message that the crisis would impact the team’s coffers — and possibly those of the league.\r\n\r\nJohnson continued talking with union and league officials, trying to offer reassurance to Clippers players and angry basketball fans, who’d started speculating as to what Silver might do and when he might do it.\r\n\r\n“We’re at a defining moment in the history of the National Basketball Association,” Johnson posted to supporters on Facebook.\r\n\r\nMomentum for some type of action began to gather steam. Mark Jackson, the head coach of Golden State, the Clippers’ opponent, suggested that Los Angeles fans boycott the following night’s game. “We cannot allow someone with these feelings to profit,” he said.\r\n\r\nPlayers elsewhere around the league demonstrated their solidarity on the court and spoke out against Sterling away from it.\r\n\r\n“For us, as basketball players, we’re all brothers,” said LeBron James, the league’s four-time most valuable player.\r\n\r\nThe Clippers were aware of the support and debating their own options. Despite the lopsided game one night earlier, Rivers canceled practice, hoping his players could mentally recuperate. “If you get your life better, then you can probably do your work better,” he said.\r\n\r\nThe league office announced a news conference in New York for the following day, but players didn’t know if Sterling would be given a pass, a light fine, a hefty suspension — or something more severe.\r\n\r\nPlayers for both the Warriors and Clippers discussed what to do if the punishment was light. They talked about boycotting the game, walking off the court right before the tip-off. But on Monday night, all they could really do was wait, not sure what fate awaited Sterling or what reaction they\'d get when they arrived at their home arena the next night.\r\n\r\n“I would be lying if I said I wasn\'t nervous about what it is going to be like,” said Paul, the team’s seven-time all-star.\r\n\r\nHealing process starts\r\n\r\nShortly after 2 p.m. Tuesday, Silver looked out over a packed room of journalists at a New York hotel ballroom. It was his biggest day as commissioner and one that promised to have repercussions for years to come.\r\n\r\n“Effective immediately,” he said, “I am banning Mr. Sterling for life.” He added that he would urge the league’s owners to force Sterling to sell his franchise.\r\n\r\nIn a small room at Los Angeles City Hall, fewer than a dozen people were watching on a television, including Johnson and past and present basketball stars Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Steve Nash and Tyson Chandler. When they heard Silver’s edict, the room erupted in cheers. The punishment was even more severe than union officials had been urging.\r\n\r\nThe Clippers were about 14 miles away, wrapping up a film session at the team practice facility when Rivers shared the news. There were no cheers and no applause. Just silence. “A collective sigh of relief,” forward Blake Griffin called it.\r\n\r\nThe team’s front office, which four days earlier had backed Sterling, released a statement saying the Clippers organization “wholeheartedly support and embrace” Silver’s decision.\r\n\r\nLater that night the Clippers players put together an emotional, 113-103 win, energizing a sold-out arena and for a couple of hours at least putting the focus back on basketball. But then the horn sounded to end the game, quickly snapping everyone back to reality.\r\n\r\n“It’ll still be an issue,” said Clippers guard J.J. Redick. “We know that.”\r\n\r\nIt was a rapid-fire four days and there are still questions to answer, lessons to parse. Rivers has been noncommittal about his own future and that of the organization beyond this season.\r\n\r\nSome players, though, sensed that what they had experienced the last four days may be pointing to a new power dynamic in the league. “That’s the way it should be,” Paul said about the owner-player relationship. “It’s not about us vs. them. I think we have an opportunity to be partners in everything we do moving forward.”\r\n\r\nThe league’s Board of Governors is expected to vote soon on whether to terminate Sterling’s ownership.\r\n\r\nSterling has made no public statements since Silver handed down the punishment and provided no hints at his course of action.\r\n\r\n“Is this over? No, it’s not over,” Rivers said. “But it’s the start of a healing process that we need, and it’s a start for our organization to try to get through this.”\r\n'
1e.txt,'title: Donald Sterling’s Race Problem—And Ours\r\n\r\nA few months ago, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, I was rushing along the street one morning when an older white man offered me a handshake and a cordial “Good morning.” His warm greeting was followed by what he meant as a sincere compliment: “You did a wonderful job painting that stoop yesterday.” I blinked in confusion, and he recognized his mistake. “Do I have the wrong one?” he asked. I assured him that I had definitely not painted his stairs the previous day, and continued across town, somewhat bemused by the encounter.\r\n\r\nThe episode stuck with me because it so perfectly embodied a kind of vintage racism, one in which all members of a particular racial group are entirely interchangeable; to respond with anger would be entirely beside the point. For many years, I was puzzled by African-Americans who collected Sambo and Mammy figurines, plantation grotesques whose distorted features expressed the prevailing arguments for slavery and segregation. But my sidewalk encounter suggested a possible rationale for these purchases: they recalled an era when people were at least candid about their racial views.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon, Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, announced that the Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling, who was recorded telling a girlfriend that he didn’t want her to bring black people to his games, will be banned for life and fined $2.5 million, and that the league will attempt to force Sterling to sell the team. Faced with grumblings about a player strike or diminished attendance during the playoffs, the league had no choice but to act quickly.\r\n\r\nIn matters of race, Malcolm X argued, American politics were divided not between liberals and conservatives but between “wolves” and “foxes”—between those whose overt contempt for black people was clear and those who successfully cloaked their disdain. To the extent that more commentary is required on the controversy surrounding Sterling, one can only point to how matters have evolved in the years since Malcolm X’s pronouncement. The undying creed of American racial optimism—bolstered anew by the election of a black President—has led us to a place where the usual principles have been inverted, where words speak louder than actions. In short, the foxes won.\r\n\r\nWe know that racism remains, as ever, a fixed element in American society. And yet, the actual articulation of racist views shocks the collective conscience—or, at least, inspires us to behave as if it has. Last month, when Paul Ryan’s lament over the laziness of “inner-city men” sparked a smaller controversy, he followed his remarks with a barely credible, though nonetheless effective, disclaimer that he wasn’t referring to any particular racial group. What makes headlines—whether in Cliven Bundy’s clueless speculation about the benefits of slavery or Donald Sterling’s Jim Crow code for his girlfriend’s Instagram—is not the presence of bigotry but the absence of subtlety.\r\n\r\nThe outrage that has emerged since the tape of Sterling’s remarks was first made public seems to betray a kind of willful collective naïveté. Our public shock suggests a belief that the views expressed by Sterling are out of the ordinary—despite the evidence indicating otherwise, despite the visible disparities between races in every meaningful statistic, and despite the protestations of those who are subjected to the dictates of race in this country.\r\n\r\nThe publication of the tape containing Sterling’s muddled racial thinking is indeed news, but the hypertensive reaction to his views inadvertently highlights our feeble understanding of how race still works in American society. Sterling has most commonly been compared to Marge Schott, the eccentric Cincinnati Reds owner whose racial views led Major League Baseball to suspend her on two separate occasions. It’s an apt comparison, but not for the reasons we suspect. Schott was castigated for referring to two outfielders as her “million-dollar niggers.” The statement, along with a bizarre defense of Hitler, were enough for Major League Baseball to issue her a first suspension, in 1993. Yet it went virtually unnoticed that these comments were revealed in the midst of a deposition about her unofficial policy of not hiring African-American workers. Sterling’s own racial history seems too perfect an illustration of this to have not been scripted as part of a social psychology experiment. Years of actual, tangibly racist actions that had real effects on the lives of minorities trying to find housing were so inconsequential that they didn’t even preclude him from being honored by the local N.A.A.C.P. A single, insipid conversation in which he tells his mistress that associating with black people will ruin her chances of passing as a “delicate” white woman threatens to derail his business career.\r\n\r\nThe N.B.A.’s decision was based, Silver said, solely upon Sterling’s comments that became public last weekend, which only further confounds the problems here. The lifetime ban limits the damage that Sterling can do to the N.B.A.’s reputation. But no punishment can resolve the deeper question of why his actions were tolerated for so long—or of how many other team owners have similar views, and perhaps similar histories, but retain the good sense not to offend our sensibilities by talking about them.'

Jason Conger of Bend. \r\n\r\nRomney\'s appeal to the general electorate in Oregon was limited in 2012. He lost the state by nearly 12 percentage points.  But Wehby indicated in a press release that Romney\'s endorsement would help raise her national profile and signal Republicans that Sen.

Jeff Merkley, the first-time candidate must defeat state Rep. Jason Conger in a May 20 primary. In the nomination fight, Wehby has a huge cash advantage, the backing of The Oregonian newspaper and has been running compelling TV ads. Democrats point to a recent internal poll for Merkley that showed her trailing the incumbent by 20 percentage points and running only neck and neck with Conger in the primary.\r\n\r\nThis is the latest primary in which Romney has chosen to play. He’s supporting Joni Ernst in a crowded GOP field for Iowa Senate. Earlier this week, he backed Neel Kashkari for California governor. Last week, he endorsed Tony Strickland for a House seat in the Golden State. And the Chamber has been running ads featuring Romney’s support for Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho) over a primary challenger.\r\n\r\nWehby was enthusiastic about getting Romney’s backing, which she cited as evidence that her race is in play.\r\n\r\n“He and I share in the belief that Washington, D.C., needs leaders who have excelled in fields other than politics — that the establishment of a permanent political class is not what our founders intended,” she said in a statement.\r\n\r\nFifteen sitting Republican senators have cut checks to Wehby’s campaign: John Thune, Richard Burr, Orrin Hatch, Rob Portman, Johnny Isakson, Mitch McConnell, Bob Corker, Susan Collins, John Barrasso, Lisa Murkowski, John McCain, Kelly Ayotte, Tom Coburn, Lamar Alexander and Saxby Chambliss.\r\n\r\nAlso contributing to Wehby: former Sen.

Two remain hospitalized.\r\n\r\nAt least one police officer was injured in the clashes, the Ukrainian Interior Ministry said, adding that shots were fired and small grenades and stones were used in the attack.\r\n\r\nPolice fired tear gas and stun grenades in an effort to disperse the activists, who were armed with clubs, batons and shields but did not appear to be carrying firearms.\r\n\r\nSome of the activists smashed windows and broke down doors as they sought to enter the building.\r\n\r\n\"We\'re going floor to floor looking for people ... for the people who were here beforehand,\" one of the militants said.\r\n\r\nOne woman earlier told a CNN team on the ground that she helped a wounded man who she said was shot by someone from inside the building.\r\n\r\nParamedics were called to help the wounded at the site Thursday afternoon.\r\n\r\nProtest march in Donetsk, rally in Kiev\r\n\r\nEarlier in the day, crowds marched through Donetsk, demanding greater autonomy for the restive eastern region.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the march, which was held to mark May Day, was a speaker who accused the authorities in Kiev of pushing pro-Russian supporters to a position where they are demanding a referendum on May 11 and a federal state.\r\n\r\nMany in the region view the interim government in Kiev as a \"junta\" that seized power thanks to backing from ultranationalist groups, and they are angered by its actions.\r\n\r\nEastern Ukraine was a heartland of support for pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych, ousted in February after months of protests by people upset that he had turned away from Europe in favor of Moscow.\r\n\r\nPro-Russian protesters already control a number of key government buildings in Donetsk, after seizing them last month, and have declared it to be the \"Donetsk People\'s Republic.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the industrial city\'s Lenin Square, where the march started, masked men could be seen atop a building next to a flag signaling support for the pro-Russian camp. The yellow and blue Ukrainian flag, which had been flying until a short time before, was thrown off the side of the building, a symbol of the spreading unrest.\r\n\r\nPro-Russian protesters in the city of Luhansk, closer to the Russian border, said Wednesday that they had seized additional government buildings because they wanted to be sure of holding the planned referendum.\r\n\r\nThe crisis has sparked deep divisions in Ukraine. Many also want to see the country remain united, but unhappiness about government corruption and ineffectiveness runs deep.\r\n\r\nIn Ukraine\'s capital, Kiev, hundreds of people joined a rally Thursday for peace and unity, organized by student and trade union groups and left-of-center parties.\r\n\r\nThe protesters called for constitutional reform, decentralization of power and new parliamentary elections.\r\n\r\nThey also called for a national referendum to decide whether Ukraine should become a federal state; if the Russian language should become the official language in some regions; and whether Ukraine should integrate with the European Union.\r\n\r\n$17.1 billion bailout approved\r\n\r\nActing Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov acknowledged this week that the central government has effectively lost control of the country\'s Donetsk and Luhansk regions to the pro-Russian separatists.\r\n\r\nA controversial referendum in Ukraine\'s southeastern Crimea region in March resulted in its annexation by Russia, a step widely condemned by the international community.\r\n\r\nLike Crimea, although not to the same extent, many in eastern Ukraine are Russian-speaking and have close cultural ties to Russia.\r\n\r\nThe interim government, which is struggling with a dire economic situation, has promised constitutional reforms to try to ease tensions ahead of national elections scheduled for May 25.\r\n\r\nIn a key sign of international support, the International Monetary Fund approved a $17.1 billion bailout for Ukraine on Thursday.\r\n\r\n\"It\'s obviously not without risk. But it\'s a necessity to respond to a member\'s request. And we have tried everything we could to mitigate the implementation risks,\" IMF chief Christine Lagarde told CNN\'s Christiane Amanpour.\r\n\r\nLagarde also noted that \"clearly there have been consequences\" for the Russian economy as a result of its intervention in Ukraine.\r\n\r\n\"If you look at the monetary policy, if you look at the capital flows, if you look at their own forecasts -- there have been consequences on the Russian economy as a result of the geopolitical situation, the uncertainty and the sanctions that have been decided,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThe European Union and United States say Moscow has not so far acted in support of an April 17 international deal aimed at easing the crisis and this week imposed additional sanctions on Russian officials and companies judged to be close to President Vladimir Putin.\r\n\r\nDiplomat accused of spying\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Ukraine has ordered the expulsion of a Russian naval diplomat after alleged spying this week, Ukraine\'s Foreign Ministry said on its Facebook page Thursday.\r\n\r\nThe statement said the attache was detained \"while he was committing spying activities on April 30th.\"\r\n\r\nThe ministry said the diplomat has to leave Ukraine as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nUkraine and Western nations have accused Russia, which NATO says has tens of thousands of troops massed by Ukraine\'s border, of supporting and coordinating separatist unrest in its eastern region.\r\n\r\nBut Russia denies any direct involvement in the disorder, which has seen pro-Russian militia groups seize government and police buildings in more than a dozen towns and cities across the region.\r\n\r\nSeparately, a senior military official told CNN the United States was awaiting additional recommendations from NATO Supreme Allied Commander Gen. Philip Breedlove on potentially expanding current military exercises and adding new ones in Eastern Europe. The goal would be to bolster \"alliance readiness.\"\r\n\r\nNATO allies, particularly those close to Ukraine, have requested a more robust alliance presence, including larger, permanent deployments on their soil. Additional troops would come from U.S. and NATO forces already in Europe. Britain also would contribute, the official said.\r\n\r\nUkraine military conscription order\r\n\r\nTurchynov signed a decree to introduce compulsory military service \"to increase the defensive powers of the country,\" his office said in a statement Thursday. Men aged 18 to 25 will be subject to the order.\r\n\r\nThe move takes account of the further escalation of the situation in eastern and southern Ukraine, as well as \"instances of overt aggression\" and the actions of pro-Russian militants, the statement said.\r\n\r\nThe aim is to maintain the armed forces and help them \"give an adequate response to real and potential threats to Ukraine,\" according to the statement.\r\n\r\nTurchynov said Wednesday that the country\'s armed forces have been put on full combat readiness because of the threat from Russia.\r\n\r\nSpeaking at a meeting with the heads of regional state administrations, he said authorities\' task was to prevent the spread of the \"terrorist threat\" from separatists and pro-Russian saboteurs to other regions of Ukraine.\r\n\r\nA military \"anti-terrorism\" operation launched last month has achieved little or nothing.\r\n\r\nThe government in Kiev has said it wants to show restraint and appears reluctant to embark on military operations against militants who are embedded in residential areas.\r\n\r\nRussia\'s Foreign Ministry responded to Turchynov\'s remarks late Wednesday by denouncing what it called \"these militaristic statements of Kiev authorities.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, militants in the town of Slavyansk continue to hold seven military observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, detained last Friday despite their diplomatic status.\r\n\r\nDenis Pushilin, self-declared chairman of the \"Donetsk People\'s Republic,\" has said the observers are NATO spies and that the activists would like to exchange them for people detained by pro-Kiev authorities.\r\n\r\nOSCE spokesman Michael Bociurkiw told CNN Thursday that its negotiators were again meeting with the separatists to discuss the release of the Western observer team. They are said to be in good health.'

4a.txt,'title: Chris Brown to Stay in Jail at Least Another Week, L.A. Judge Orders\r\n\r\nChris Brown must stay locked up in the Los Angeles County jail for at least another week while his lawyer negotiates with the prosecutor about his probation violation, a judge said Thursday.\r\n\r\nBrown attended a hearing Thursday wearing an orange jail suit, just hours after a cross-country trip from Washington to Los Angeles on the federal government’s “Con Air” inmate transport system.\r\n\r\nBrown lawyer Mark Geragos and Assistant District Attorney Mary Murray agreed to hold talks over the next week concerning Brown possibly admitting that he violated his probation. If that happens, it will be announced at a hearing next Friday. Otherwise, the judge will set a date for a trial on his probation revocation.\r\n\r\nGeragos said he would also file a motion to have Brown released from jail, which would be considered at the May 9 hearing.\r\n\r\nBrown, who turns 25 next Monday, spent most of the past week traveling back to Los Angeles following a delay in the start of his trial on a misdemeanor assault charge in Washington.\r\n\r\nU.S. Marshals, who took Brown from the Los Angeles County jail for extradition to Washington four weeks ago, handed him back to Los Angeles Sheriff’s deputies just hours before Thursday’s hearing, according to Deputy U.S. Marshal Laura Vegas.\r\n\r\nBrown’s probation for the 2009 beating of ex-girlfriend Rihanna Fenty was revoked after his Washington arrest. He’s spent the past six weeks in custody and previous five months in court-ordered rehab.\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor said last week that she would “strenuously object” to Brown being released because it appears likely Brown will be found guilty of the assault charge in Washington. Assistant District Attorney Mary Murray argued the only change since Brown was jailed in March is that his case has “gotten worse.” The Washington judge who found his bodyguard guilty in the assault case also concluded that Brown was “the initial aggressor” in the incident, Murray said.\r\n\r\nA Los Angeles judge refused a request last week to free the singer from custody so he could make his own way back from Washington.\r\n\r\nHe and bodyguard Christopher Hollosy were arrested on assault charges in Washington for allegedly beating a man who tried to take a photo of Brown last October.\r\n\r\nThe arrest led to a revocation of Brown’s probation, but he was allowed to enter a rehab program instead of going to jail.

Brandlin ordered Brown to return to court on May 9 when a possible deal could be addressed in court.\r\n\r\nNo possible terms were discussed Thursday.\r\n\r\nBrown could face continued confinement or other punishment if Brandlin or another judge determines he violated his probation by getting arrested after a man was punched in October outside a hotel in the nation\'s capital.\r\n\r\nBrandlin revoked Brown\'s probation in December and ordered him into rehab for anger management and other issues.\r\n\r\nBrown\'s attorney Mark Geragos said if a deal could not be reached by Tuesday, he would request the release of the singer.\r\n\r\n\"I\'m hopeful that we get it resolved, and we get it resolved quickly,\" Geragos said. \"He turns 25 next week. So I\'d like to give him an early birthday present if I can.\"\r\n\r\nThe Grammy winner has been in custody since March 14 when he was expelled from a court-ordered rehab for violating its rules.\r\n\r\nBrown\'s trial on a misdemeanor assault charge in Washington is on hold while his bodyguard appeals an assault conviction for the same incident.\r\n\r\nBrown did not speak during the hearing on Thursday but smiled at his mother and other supporters.'

If that happens, it will be announced at a hearing next Friday. Otherwise, the judge will set a date for a trial on his probation revocation.\r\n\r\nGeragos said he would also file a motion to have Brown released from jail, which would be considered at the May 9 hearing.\r\n\r\nBrown, who turns 25 next Monday, spent most of the past week traveling back to Los Angeles following a delay in the start of his trial on a misdemeanor assault charge in Washington.\r\n\r\nU.S. Marshals, who took Brown from the Los Angeles County jail for extradition to Washington four weeks ago, handed him back to Los Angeles Sheriff’s deputies just hours before Thursday’s hearing, according to Deputy U.S. Marshal Laura Vegas.\r\n\r\nBrown’s probation for the 2009 beating of ex-girlfriend Rihanna Fenty was revoked after his Washington arrest. He’s spent the past six weeks in custody and previous five months in court-ordered rehab.\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor said last week that she would “strenuously object” to Brown being released because it appears likely Brown will be found guilty of the assault charge in Washington. Assistant District Attorney Mary Murray argued the only change since Brown was jailed in March is that his case has “gotten worse.” The Washington judge who found his bodyguard guilty in the assault case also concluded that Brown was “the initial aggressor” in the incident, Murray said.\r\n\r\nA Los Angeles judge refused a request last week to free the singer from custody so he could make his own way back from Washington.\r\n\r\nHe and bodyguard Christopher Hollosy were arrested on assault charges in Washington for allegedly beating a man who tried to take a photo of Brown last October.\r\n\r\nThe arrest led to a revocation of Brown’s probation, but he was allowed to enter a rehab program instead of going to jail. He was ordered to jail last month when he was kicked out of the rehab program for rules violations.\r\n\r\n“I think it’s a little over the top to have him in custody on this misdemeanor when everybody saw the bodyguard’s trial and which was nothing more than a bloody nose,” Brown lawyer Mark Geragos told reporters in Washington last week. “And you have got the bodyguard who was convicted and who readily admitted he was the one who did the punching.

5a.txt,'title: How Craig Ferguson Unmade The Late-Night Talk Show\r\n\r\nAs has become the recent custom over at CBS, when Craig Ferguson decided to announce his departure from The Late Late Show on Monday, he had a self-deprecating joke ready.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks everybody! That was quite convincing!\" , as the audience groaned at news he would leave the network\'s 12:35 a.m. show in December. \"I\'ll go and do something else. Probably, I\'m thinking, carpentry.\"\r\n\r\nSome fans might assume Ferguson is leaving because CBS hired someone else to take the top job in the network\'s late night universe, handing Comedy Central\'s Stephen Colbert the hosting gig on the 11:35 p.m. Late Show when host David Letterman announced his retirement weeks ago.\r\n\r\nBut the Scottish-born comic that he had planned to leave his show long before Letterman shocked the showbiz world by unexpectedly announcing his retirement April 3. Once that happened, Ferguson had to keep his mouth shut while the world reacted to Letterman and CBS announced Colbert as his successor.\r\n\r\nI believe Ferguson, because when I visited his show for a feature story in 2007, he told me he couldn\'t see sticking with the program past his then-six-year contract. \"I just don\'t know if I like being that visible,\" , musing a bit about a post-Late Show life spent writing standup bits and books from a seaside bungalow in Florida. \"I don\'t know if I would want to ramp that up any more, you know. And people here find that, I think, quite difficult to (understand).\"\r\n\r\nIf what Ferguson says is true, then the network surely has a succession plan in mind for him as well. And given how quickly they moved on announcing the Colbert hire, it might not be long before we\'re talking about how the next guy (or gal, hopefully) is going to help reinvent late night TV on the network of NCIS and CSI.\r\n\r\nBut first, let\'s take a moment to give props to Ferguson, a wildly talented performer who succeeded – and failed – because he insisted on creating a late-night talk show for people who hate most late-night talk shows.\r\n\r\nBasically, Ferguson busted up the rigid formula of late night TV wherever he could, producing a show that could split sides one moment and leave you wondering if you stumbled on a celebrity-studded acid trip in the next.\r\n\r\nSome of the stuff is obvious. Early in his tenure, Ferguson jettisoned a mostly-planned monologue for a stream-of-consciousness way of speaking to the camera that was more genuine and more funny. Sometimes the program would begin in a \"cold open\" with a puppet rabbit interrogating an audience member; other times, he spoke openly about the life and death of his father or explained why, as a recovering alcoholic, he on poking fun at the debilitating meltdowns of Britney Spears.\r\n\r\nHe never had a backing band – in part, early on, it was likely a money thing. But even after CBS upgraded his studio, Ferguson avoided the bandleader sidekick and live music, instead trading banter with a skeletal robot and with two people in horse\'s costume. Really.\r\n\r\nAs interviews began with guests, Ferguson would symbolically rip up his blue note cards as a way of signifying that what was coming wasn\'t really planned. Sometimes, that brought a lot of empty riffing with a celebrity who just couldn\'t keep up. But sometimes, you got (warning: parts of this are a little NSFW).\r\n\r\nFerguson took over The Late Late Show in 2005 from Craig Kilborn, himself a refugee from Comedy Central\'s Daily Show. CBS actually tried a succession of guest hosts in the job after Kilborn failed, and Ferguson was the unlikely-yet-compelling permanent choice.\r\n\r\nWhere Kilborn was smug and overly scripted, Ferguson was genuine and spontaneous (Kilborn has the dubious distinction of hosting two shows which were turned into creative successes after he left them). And when Ferguson occasionally got serious – in talking about race relations or staying sober or dealing with death – it was because in whatever he was talking about in that moment.\r\n\r\nThis was a show created by a star who chafed at all the typical conventions of a late-night talk show. The result was an unpredictable program which was often funny, sometimes amazing and occasionally just strange and not quite complete.\r\n\r\nSmall wonder that more traditional shows hosted by Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers beat The Late Late Show in ratings. And it\'s also no surprise that Ferguson might get tired of re-inventing the form every night and just move on (he already has his next TV gig lined up: hosting his syndicated game show Celebrity Name Game).\r\n\r\nBeyond hoping they don\'t hire yet another white male, I\'m crossing my fingers that CBS succeeds Ferguson with someone just as willing to blow up conventional ideas of what a late night talk show can and should be.\r\n\r\nAs legacies go, that might be the best one yet, especially for a host who often called himself \"TV\'s Craig Ferguson\" – an offhand description that seemed equal parts ironic jab and grudging admission of his circumstance.\r\n\r\nAnd as final tribute, please enjoy 13 minutes of Ferguson-centered craziness, courtesy of YouTube.'
5b.txt,'title: Craig Ferguson Leaving ‘Late Late Show’\r\n\r\nCBS is down one more late-night host – Craig Ferguson just announced to his studio audience that he would not be re-upping his contract to host Late Late Show and will step down in December. “CBS and I are not getting divorced, we are ‘consciously uncoupling,’ but we will still spend holidays together and share custody of the fake horse and robot skeleton, both of whom we love very much,” Ferguson said in the announcement, which immediately triggered speculation as to who would replace him.\r\n\r\nFerguson is sticking around until year’s end to give show staff time to figure things out, according to a source with knowledge of the situation. But, with Ferguson leaving in December, it’s likely CBS will have a new 12:35 AM host on its air before Stephen Colbert replaces David Letterman — Colbert is likewise leaving his Comedy Central series The Colbert Report at the end of the calendar year, but David Letterman has yet to set his end date on Late Show — only saying it will be some time in 2015.\r\n\r\nFerguson has been Late Late Show’s host since succeeding Craig Kilborn in January 2005; his contract was set to expire this summer, so it had been widely expected some decision on his CBS late-night future would be reached soon-ish. And all America recently was brought up to speed on the clause in that contract that landed him a pot of cash if the network looked elsewhere for its David Letterman replacement.  That happened when CBS went with Stephen Colbert after Dave also surprised his studio audience with news he was stepping down in 2015.  But Ferguson was quick to tweet his congratulations to Colbert the morning the news broke. That night, Ferguson opened his show with another shout-out to Colbert, after which he teased viewers with cracks about resigning — but only for the length of a commercial.\r\n\r\nWhile CBS Entertainment chief Nina Tassler had insisted publicly CBS loves Ferguson, CBS CEO Leslie Moonves recently acknowledged Ferguson’s time slot was up for grabs and said “we’re having conversations” but “there’s nothing to report now.” CBS execs were said to be frustrated that the numbers haven’t grown on Ferguson’s show, currently co-produced by CBS and Letterman’s Worldwide Pants, though others suggested that was just the rumblings of a network prepping its position should its star take a hike.\r\n\r\nToday, Tassler said, “During his 10 years as host, Craig has elevated CBS to new creative and competitive heights at 12:30. He infused the broadcast with tremendous energy, unique comedy, insightful interviews and some of the most heartfelt monologues seen on television.” She added, “While we’ll miss Craig and can’t thank him enough for his contributions to both the show and the network, we respect his decision to move on, and we look forward to celebrating his final broadcasts during the next eight months.”\r\n\r\nAnd ratings were only half the story: CBS, which will own Late Show when Letterman steps down (Worldwide Pants owns its current iteration), is hellbent on returning the daypart to greater profitability under Colbert. You may have heard the one about late-night TV profits curling up like the tendrils of a delicate plant ignored by the gardener in the later days of Letterman’s and Jay Leno’s runs, what with costs going up and ad revenue going down.\r\n\r\nThroughout the process, CBS spent time initially denying it was talking to Chelsea Handler about replacing Craig, while her camp did its best to fan the flames. “There are no discussions with Chelsea Handler regarding the network’s 12:30 late night broadcast,” the network said after Handler posted a photo of herself taking a “business meeting” with CBS paperwork in her hand, conveniently turned around so the camera easily could read it. The CBS logo was visible as was the word “distribution” suggesting CBS Televisision Distribution — syndicator of Arsenio Hall’s late-night show.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Ferguson and his Green Mountain West Inc production house has been busy making late-night aftershows for various Discovery Network shows,  including Shark After Dark and Naked After Dark. Last month, Discovery’s Science Channel bought Ferguson’s I F-ing Love Science series — which has yet to name a host. That series is inspired by the popular Facebook page I F*cking Love Science, which has attracted more than 11M social media followers since it was created three years ago by British biology student Elise Andrew, who is onboard as a consulting producer. The series is produced by Green Mountain West and Karga7 Productions and will premiere in the fourth quarter, featuring a blend of live-action, animation, and re-creations showcasing the random connectivity of science with appearances by celebrities and scientists. Ferguson himself made the announcement via taped message at Science Channel’s SXSW Interactive event.\r\n\r\nIn December, DebMar Mercury announced the Ferguson-hosted Celebrity Name Game is set to launch on 58 Sinclair stations, four CBS O&Os and others, pushing clearances for the fall 2014 syndicated pop culture game show past 80\% of the U.S — up from 40\% in less than a month. Tribune Broadcasting previously came aboard, acquiring Celebrity Name Game for all 25 of its stations. The half-hour strip, based on the board game Identity Crisis, was developed by Courteney Cox and David Arquette’s Coquette Prods with Scott St. John (Deal Or No Deal), who will serve as showrunner. Ferguson’s involvement stems from the project’s first incarnation at CBS where Coquette sold it as a pilot two years ago under the title Identity Crisis with Ferguson hosting. Celebrity Name Game is co-produced and co-financed by FremantleMedia North America and Debmar-Mercury.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, here is how Ferguson recommended Jay Leno spend his last night as a late-night talk show host at NBC, before Leno left Tonight show, for the second time, in  February:'

Ferguson\'s show airs after Letterman\'s, at 12:35 a.m. on weekdays.\r\n\r\nThe move was no surprise after CBS announced that Stephen Colbert will replace Letterman next year. There was a time that Ferguson, whose show won a Peabody Award in 2009, was considered a strong contender for that job.\r\n\r\nBut \"The Late Late Show\" has faded in the ratings, particularly with the arrival of Seth Meyers in February as competition in the same time slot.\r\n\r\n\"CBS and I are not getting divorced, we are consciously uncoupling,\" Ferguson said. \"But we will still spend holidays together and share custody of the fake horse and robot skeleton, both of whom we love very much.\"\r\n\r\nHe told the audience it was his decision to leave, adding, \"CBS has been fine with me.\"\r\n\r\nCBS Entertainment Chairwoman Nina Tassler said Ferguson \"infused the broadcast with tremendous energy, unique comedy, insightful interviews and some of the most heartfelt monologues seen on television.\"\r\n\r\nThe Scottish-born Ferguson, 51, became a U.S. citizen during his tenure on the show.\r\n\r\nHe already has a new job lined up, as host of \"Celebrity Name Game,\" a syndicated game show set to debut later this year.\r\n\r\nBut he joked about his plans with the audience.\r\n\r\nAfter his stint ends, \"I\'ll go and do something else.

I feel like doing this show for 10 years, that\'s enough,\" he said.\r\n\r\nGuest LL Cool J told Ferguson that \"I hate to see you go.\"\r\n\r\nIt\'s been an unusually busy period of personnel changes in the late-night television arena. Jimmy Fallon took over the \"Tonight\" show on NBC from Jay Leno in February and was an instant sensation, ascending to the top of the ratings against Letterman and ABC\'s Jimmy Kimmel. Letterman announced that he would be leaving CBS after more than three decades in late-night TV.\r\n\r\nChelsea Handler also has said she will be leaving her late-night show on E!\r\n\r\nCBS said it plans to continue \"The Late Late Show\" and will be searching for another host.

5d.txt,'title: A guide to Craig Ferguson’s weirdest traditions you’ll never see on late-night TV again after this year\r\n\r\nWith Craig Ferguson announcing on Monday night that he will be stepping down from “The Late Late Show” in December, that means you only have eight more months to witness a talking robot skeleton on TV.\r\n\r\nPrepare to say farewell to Geoff Petereson the robot, the Snake Mug, the Awkward Pause, and many of other truly bizarre elements that have become staples of Ferguson’s wacky late-night program. Really, it’s the kind of stuff you can only get away with when your show airs from 12:30 a.m. to 1:30 a.m.\r\n\r\nHave no idea what we’re talking about? Here’s a guide to some of Ferguson’s most bizarre traditions that you’ll likely never see again on late-night TV:\r\n\r\nGeoff Peterson the robot skeleton\r\n\r\nLetterman has Paul Shaffer, Conan has Andy Richter and Ferguson has Geoff the robot skeleton. What? It all started in spring 2010 as Ferguson fretted that he didn’t have a classic sidekick like so many other hosts. The end result? “Mythbusters” star Grant Imahara challenged Ferguson (who called his fans his robot skeleton army) that if he could get Imahara 100,000 Twitter followers, he would build Ferguson an actual robot skeleton sidekick.  Sure enough, Imahara followed through on his promise. Geoff was born (voiced by comedian Josh Robert Thompson) and has been an integral part of the show ever since, always there with a quick one-liner.\r\n\r\nSecretariat the costumed horse\r\n\r\nNo, you’re not hallucinating if it’s 12:30 a.m. and you see a giant costumed horse galloping around on your TV — that’s just Secretariat, another Ferguson sidekick that appears, sometimes carrying guests. This delightful tradition began in 2010 shortly after Disney’s “Secretariat” movie came out, and when Ferguson was going through his reader mail, someone asked Ferguson if he had seen it. No, he had not, but he did take the occasion to make a fake trailer featuring Secretariat’s first appearance. The sight was so hilarious that Ferguson started bringing Secretariat out just to dance — and when people started complaining “enough with the horse,” Secretariat’s appearances just increased until he was a mainstay.\r\n\r\nThe rattlesnake mug\r\n\r\nOriginally just a gag gift from actress Mary McCormack during a 2009 visit, Ferguson quickly became obsessed with the mug from Albuquerque’s National Rattlesnake Museum (McCormack had just been in New Mexico shooting a movie). ”Oh God, I love it!” Ferguson yelled. He threw his boring old coffee mug on the ground, where it promptly shattered. “I don’t need this crap,” he said as McCormack gasped in horror at the broken glass. “This is the new cup.” He kept that promise.\r\n\r\nAll the puppets\r\n\r\nThere are too many to name, but occasionally Ferguson will kick things off with a puppet looking directly into a camera. It could be a shark or a rabbit, depending on the day.\r\n\r\nAwkward pauses\r\n\r\nInstead of waiting for awkwardness to happen, Ferguson just embraces it. Seriously, he forces his guests to have awkward pauses, with varying results of genuine awkwardness.\r\n\r\nThe fake fireplace\r\n\r\nSometimes you need to throw a real log into a fake fireplace, just because.\r\n\r\n“What did we learn on the show tonight, Craig?”\r\n\r\nAn important question and one that Ferguson will address as he summarizes the show — but only preceded by a jingle with a kitten involved.\r\n\r\nTearing up the notecards\r\n\r\nFerguson couldn’t stand the fact that producers left him notecards with potential questions for his guests, and one day before interviewing Alec Baldwin in 2008 he mocked the card (first question: “How have you been?”) and tore it up, throwing away the ripped up pieces. It’s been that way ever since.\r\n\r\nBest friendship with Kristen Bell\r\n\r\nThis one isn’t so much weird as it is random and wonderful, and we’ll miss it. You know how some late-night hosts just hit it off with some guests more than others? This is the perfect example, as the odd couple duo is delightful to watch. Bell even accompanied Ferguson as a co-host when he took his show to Paris.'
5e.txt,'title: David Letterman addresses Craig Ferguson leaving \'Late Late Show\'\r\n\r\nThe late night landscape shifted once again Monday when Craig Ferguson announced he\'d be leaving his post on \"The Late Late Show\" at year\'s end. The talk show, which followed David Letterman\'s \"Late Show\" on CBS, was also produced by Letterman\'s Worldwide Pants production company. On Tuesday\'s show, Letterman briefly addressed Ferguson\'s departure.\r\n\r\n\"His show was unlike any other late-night show,\" Letterman said during a desk segment. \"And I\'m telling ya, to be unique in the world of television, virtually impossible.\"\r\n\r\nLetterman said he understood Ferguson had another show in the works for himself, which Ferguson did not mention when he made his announcement on Monday\'s program.\r\n\r\n\"Congratulations on a great run,\" Letterman said. \"And we all wish him well.\"\r\n\r\nFerguson took over \"Late Late Show\" in 2005 after the previous host, Craig Kilborn, decided not to continue as the host. The Scottish-born comedian attempted to shake up the format of the late-night talk show by sometimes shifting segments around so as to not always begin with a stand-up monologue, and usually engaged in spontaneous conversations with his guests instead of rigidly predetermined banter.\r\n\r\nWith Ferguson leaving in December, CBS will once again have a chance to reshape the late night competition. Stephen Colbert will be taking over Letterman\'s time slot sometime in 2015 and there is a strong push from many quarters to make a woman part of the late night mix.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-david-letterman-addresses-craig-ferguson-leaving-late-late-show-20140430,0,5137425.story#ixzz30W3G2zZf\r\n\r\n'

6c.txt,'title: Security Flaw Hits Microsoft Browser\r\n\r\nIn case those with personal computers running Windows XP still need a reason to replace or update their machines, Microsoft has just given them a great one with the disclosure of a nasty security hole in the company’s web browser, Internet Explorer.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft issued a warning about the security hole in an advisory on Saturday, warning that attackers can exploit the flaw simply by persuading people to visit websites, where malicious code could be used to steal data from their computers. The company said it was aware of “limited, targeted attacks” that tried to exploit the flaw, though it did not provide more details about them.\r\n\r\nAlthough the security flaw affects various versions of Internet Explorer browsers running on newer computers with the Windows 7 and Windows 8 operating systems, the problem is especially troubling for the millions of people still using Windows XP. Because Microsoft ended technical support for Windows XP this month, the company will not issue any security updates for the operating system, including for the flaw disclosed on Saturday.\r\n\r\nThe flaw was discovered by FireEye Research Labs, part of the security company FireEye Inc.\r\n\r\nWindows XP was first introduced by Microsoft more than 12 years ago. Computers running the software are comically outdated compared with later machines. That still does not change the fact, however, that more than a quarter of the computers connected to the Internet are still running Windows XP, according to NetMarketShare.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is working on a final software update to remedy the security hole in Internet Explorer on its modern operating systems. Internet Explorer versions 6 through 11, the latest, are affected. In the meantime, the company recommends several precautions, including making sure that Internet Explorer is configured to run in enhanced protected mode, to lessen the risks from the security flaw.\r\n\r\nOne remedy for Windows XP users is to use an alternative Web browser such as Chrome or Firefox. The security hole should also get people thinking seriously about upgrading to a computer running a newer operating system.'

Windows XP is capable of running Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8.\r\n\r\nThis new remote code execution vulnerability, dubbed CVE-2014-1776, has the potential to give hackers the same user rights as the current user.

Most Windows users run their PCs under an administrator account.\r\n\r\nThese attacks aren\'t theoretical, either—security firm FireEye discovered these attacks being actively used in the wild. For these attacks to work, however, a user would have to visit a malicious website attempting to install the code. Microsoft says attacks could also come from \"websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements\" where an attacker could insert malicious code.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has yet to decide whether it will issue an emergency patch in the coming days or wait for patch Tuesday on May 13 to repair supported versions of IE. \r\n\r\n Whenever Microsoft issues the patch, a significant portion of Windows PC users won\'t be receiving the security update. Microsoft officially ended support for Microsoft XP on April 8, and the aging OS will no longer receive security updates as a result. So unless Microsoft does an about face, this appears to be the first post-support vulnerability where XP users are left to fend for themselves. Many more are sure to follow.\r\n\r\nAt last count, Windows XP accounted for nearly 28 percent of all online PCs worldwide. That\'s more than Windows 8, 8.1, Vista, OS X 10.9, and Linux users combined, according to the latest numbers from Net MarketShare.\r\n\r\nLuckily, Windows XP users can easily mitigate this vulnerability by simply using any Web browser but Internet Explorer. For longtime IE users on XP, turning to Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox would be your best bet, both immediately and going forward.\r\n\r\nGoogle has promised to support the XP version of Google Chrome until April 2015, while Mozilla has yet to announce a Firefox end-of-support date for XP. Should a vulnerability hit either of those browsers on XP it will be patched, unlike IE.\r\n\r\nFor those who absolutely must use IE, Microsoft advises downloading and installing the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) 4.1. This utility helps to protect against malware and is available for Windows XP PCs with service pack 3 installed.\r\n\r\nYou can also run IE in a more secure mode by going to Internet Option s> Security and setting the slider to High.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft\'s Saturday alert may be the first example of a serious exploit already in the wild that will put Windows XP users permanently at risk. It won\'t, however, be the last, security experts say. In March, security firm Avast said that Windows XP was already under attack six times more often than Windows 7—and that was before the OS went end-of-life. \r\n'
6e.txt,'title: Microsoft Rushes To Fix Major Internet Explorer Security Flaw\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Corp is rushing to fix a bug in its widely used Internet Explorer web browser after a computer security firm disclosed the flaw over the weekend, saying hackers have already exploited it in attacks on some U.S. companies.\r\n\r\nPCs running Windows XP will not receive any updates fixing that bug when they are released, however, because Microsoft stopped supporting the 13-year-old operating system earlier this month. Security firms estimate that between 15 and 25 percent of the world\'s PCs still run Windows XP\r\n\r\nMicrosoft disclosed on Saturday its plans to fix the bug in an advisory to its customers posted on its security website, which it said is present in Internet Explorer versions 6 to 11. Those versions dominate desktop browsing, accounting for 55 percent of the PC browser market, according to tech research firm NetMarketShare.\r\n\r\nCybersecurity software maker FireEye Inc said that a sophisticated group of hackers have been exploiting the bug in a campaign dubbed \"Operation Clandestine Fox.\"\r\n\r\nFireEye, whose Mandiant division helps companies respond to cyber attacks, declined to name specific victims or identify the group of hackers, saying that an investigation into the matter is still active.\r\n\r\n\"It\'s a campaign of targeted attacks seemingly against U.S.-based firms, currently tied to defense and financial sectors,\" FireEye spokesman Vitor De Souza said via email. \"It\'s unclear what the motives of this attack group are, at this point. It appears to be broad-spectrum intel gathering.\"\r\n\r\nHe declined to elaborate, though he said one way to protect against them would be to switch to another browser.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft said in the advisory that the vulnerability could allow a hacker to take complete control of an affected system, then do things such as viewing, changing, or deleting data, installing malicious programs, or creating accounts that would give hackers full user rights.\r\n\r\nFireEye and Microsoft have not provided much information about the security flaw or the approach that hackers could use to figure out how to exploit it, said Aviv Raff, chief technology officer of cybersecurity firm Seculert.\r\n\r\nYet other groups of hackers are now racing to learn more about it so they can launch similar attacks before Microsoft prepares a security update, Raff said.\r\n\r\n\"Microsoft should move fast,\" he said. \"This will snowball.\"\r\n\r\nStill, he cautioned that Windows XP users will not benefit from that update since Microsoft has just halted support for that product.\r\n\r\nThe software maker said in a statement to Reuters that it advises Windows XP users to upgrade to one of two most recently versions of its operating system, Windows 7 or 8.'
7a.txt,'title: Xbox Originals ups Microsoft\'s TV game. Will viewers play along?\r\n\r\nLast week, in an industrial-themed San Francisco loft full of sleek furniture, flat screens, and Xbox One consoles, Microsoft showed polished trailers for half a dozen original TV shows it plans to start airing in June. Some are green-lighted projects in production now, while others are still in development. In total, the company intends to serve up 12 original series to its Xbox audience.\r\n\r\nBut the Halo live-action TV show produced by Steven Spielberg, and announced alongside the Xbox One last May, was nowhere to be seen. The project is well under way, Microsoft says, but it\'s not ready to be shown off. In its place is a slate of shows designed for mainstream audiences, the kind of programs you might expect to see alongside \"The Big Bang Theory,\" \"How I Met Your Mother,\" and \"The Voice.\"\r\n\r\nThat\'s no surprise, given who\'s running the show. Microsoft\'s TV ambitions are the purview of the 2-year old Xbox Originals division, which is headed by former CBS TV President Nancy Tellem.\r\n\r\nWorking out of a Los Angeles-based studio -- with teams strewn across Santa Monica, Calif., Redmond, Wash., and Vancouver -- Tellem, who helped create \"Friends\" and \"ER\" and oversaw programming for \"Survivor\" and \"CSI,\" is charged with leading the Xbox platform to the forefront of digital-first programming.\r\n\r\nWhat the forefront looks like, however, is unclear. Even with experienced leadership, a sizable war chest, and original content -- from notable comedy stars including Seth Green and Sarah Silverman and big directors like Spielberg and Ridley Scott -- Microsoft is wading into a crowded arena, with Netflix and Amazon already in the lead.\r\n\r\nAnd not helping these ambitions is the fact that the Xbox division is seen as a drag on Microsoft\'s bottom line, leading some Microsoft investors to advise the company to jettison the unit -- along with its consumer-hardware efforts involving the Surface tablet -- to focus on its enterprise business.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of Satya Nadella as Microsoft\'s new CEO earlier this year hasn\'t illuminated much about any change in Microsoft\'s commitment to Xbox or how the device fits in to the company\'s \"mobile-first, cloud-first\" world. However, Nadella\'s decision to promote Phil Spencer -- the former head of the company\'s game-development venture, Microsoft Studios -- to run every facet of the Xbox division indicates that Microsoft sees games and Xbox as a lucrative way to bridge the gap between its many arms.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the goal is to try to turn the Xbox platform into the delivery system, across all Microsoft\'s devices, for a new kind of digital-media venture that\'s about more than just games. Think of it as the natural extension of the company\'s bid for the living room, with the Xbox as its Trojan horse. What to do once you\'re past the wall and inside the city is a different breed of challenge. \r\n\r\n\"Microsoft has given us the opportunity to look at the next iteration of television and take media closer to the tech industry,\" Tellem said during a Q&A session last week. \"As our content is distributed across Microsoft devices and services you can imagine our audience will broaden as well. With that in mind, we are first and foremost developing original content for the 85 million Xbox owners who are predominantly millennial males.\"\r\n\r\nTellem does admit that there\'s some ambiguity surrounding Xbox Originals\' direction. \"We don\'t know,\" she said when describing the potential appeal of Microsoft\'s lineup of shows. \"Knowing our audience, we\'ll know pretty soon once we put it up if they\'ll respond positively.\"\r\n\r\nMicrosoft will soon be brushing up against Netflix, with the video-streaming site\'s Emmy-nominated \"House of Cards\" and \"Orange is the New Black;\" Amazon, with original shows like \"Betas\" and \"Alpha House;\" and Hulu, with \"Battleground\" and \"Spoilers.\" AOL and Yahoo are entering the original content mix as well, having announced their plans earlier this week. Yahoo said it will deliver its first two comedy series in 2015. AOL is partnering with Nielsen for ratings -- a first for on-demand programming -- and creating 16 shows, featuring actors and producers like James Franco, Steve Buscemi, Sarah Jessica Parker, Zoe Saldana, and Ellen DeGeneres. \r\n\r\nWith 85 million consoles sold worldwide, between Xbox 360 and Xbox One, and 48 million of those consoles with an Xbox Live subscription, Microsoft has a good sense of its potential audience size. The company said its audience already watches TV on its consoles more than it plays games. Microsoft\'s Xbox One currently sits at No. 87 on the CNET 100 leaderboard.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is developing its own shows to go with those from other streaming services and traditional TV networks. As for delivery and pricing -- meaning which Xbox users get what content and for what cost -- the company is still working it out. Tellem has said the company will likely put some of its series behind the $60 per year Xbox Live Gold paywall and release other series more widely on a case-by-case basis. Xbox Live Gold is the subscription service that lets users access apps like Netflix and play video games online. At the very least, that will give 48 million people the potential to watch some of Microsoft\'s original programming.\r\n\r\nEven as it works to make the Xbox a broader consumer entertainment platform, Microsoft Entertainment Studios executives such as newly appointed Executive Vice President Jordan Levin (who Tellem poached from the TV industry) are steadfast in their defense of the gaming focus.\r\n\r\n\"None of the activity we\'re pursuing is coming at the expense of any of the investment that\'s been made in the platform overall or gaming overall,\" Levin said at a press briefing last week for Xbox Originals, attended by gaming website Polygon.\r\n\r\nStill, while game titles like Gears of War and Fable are possible franchises for live-action TV series, none except Halo are yet in development.\r\n\r\nThe meaningful analog to all of Microsoft\'s complex maneuvering is Amazon, which -- like Microsoft -- now runs both a television and video game development studio while delivering shows from competing streaming services on its own hardware. Amazon will do anything and everything it can to create value out of having a Prime membership alongside its Kindle tablets and Fire TV media-streaming box, even if that means starting up and then canceling two dozen TV shows.\r\n\r\nFor Microsoft, it\'s not as clear-cut. Tellem and Levin won\'t say for sure what the long-term goal is, whether it\'s to increase the value of Xbox Live Gold or to pump up the Xbox One user base. That raises a couple of rather large questions: Is Microsoft trying to compete with the likes of Netflix and Amazon? And if not, do viewers need another 12 TV shows in their lives?\r\n\r\n\"We have Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon on our platform, so it really is not a question that we\'re competing with them -- because frankly we\'re not,\" Tellem said when pressed about Microsoft\'s relationship with the very services that made its platform an entertainment center.\r\n\r\nSo what does Microsoft have to offer that its rivals don\'t? Xbox Originals, Tellem said, is in the unique position to change the perspective of watching passively on your couch to an approach that blends its gaming DNA with the TV experience.\r\n\r\n\"I think first of all if we can keep the content standpoint at a certain level, very high, and also add that interactive capability, I think that\'s a big differentiator,\" Tellem said. \"They\'re offering linear content. We have the interactivity.\" Examples of interactivity will go beyond the real-time voting Microsoft allowed during the 2012 presidential debates to show-specific features built exclusively for the program. For example, Xbox One users with a cable subscription and a fantasy football team can put up their team info on the screen and manage it alongside live NFL games.\r\n\r\nWould Microsoft let other streaming services offering original programming develop interactive features for Xbox? \"Sure,\" Tellem said. But the example she provided -- the partnership with the NFL announced last year -- didn\'t directly address whether Microsoft would let Netflix build custom interactive features for season two of \"House of Cards,\" for instance. \r\n\r\nThe Xbox Originals interactive team consists of about 125 people based in Vancouver, Tellem said. \"If there\'s any pitch that we have enough of a hint that we think there\'s something cool there that we want them [the interactive team] to hear, from inception they\'re in it,\" Levin added. \"We don\'t pick anything up without running stuff past them.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a snag in Microsoft\'s ambitions to make interactive features the main draw. That\'s the fact that the Xbox One install base has yet to break 5 million units. The interactive features are geared toward the $499 next-gen console, not the Xbox 360, which has been around since 2005. Microsoft shipped 800,000 Xbox 360 units in the first three months of 2014, and during Black Friday last year sold almost 1 million units in a single week, meaning that growth of the console\'s installed base is slowing down, but it\'s still the overwhelming majority for the Xbox platform.\r\n\r\n\"The capabilities of Xbox One are really different than 360,\" Tellem said. \"Whatever we produce will be on both platforms, but clearly, some of the things you\' ll be able to do only on Xbox One, [but] certainly we hope we can achieve a similar experience.\" With nearly 80 million Xbox 360s out in the wild, and the Xbox 360 accounting for 43 million of the 48 million active Live accounts that will presumably determine your ability to watch Xbox original series, the reach of interactivity will remain severely limited for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nStill, 48 million viewers, regardless of what special features they\'re able to access, is nothing to scoff at, Tellem notes. \"It will be only on Xbox or best on Xbox,\" Tellem said, quoting the internal motto outlining Xbox Originals\' guiding principle. It translates to, \"We will have everything you could ever want to watch.\"\r\n\r\nIt remains to be seen whether Microsoft can make the Xbox the center for all entertainment -- and figure out the right business model, or how Halo and the live-action game series could really help Xbox Originals stand apart. For now, the company has thrown enough paint on the walls to guarantee that it\'s in this for the long haul.\r\n\r\n\"We see this as a very long journey. We\'ve learned that things don\'t happen overnight,\" Tellem said. \"Hits happen in the most indirect and bizarre ways.\" \r\n'

7e.txt,'title: Microsoft Sees The Future Of TV In An Old-School Role-Playing Game\r\n\r\nMicrosoft announced on Monday that it’s developing original television shows for the Xbox, and the list of programs is about what you’d expect for that audience: reality competitions, sketch comedy, and an adaptation of the multi-billion dollar Halo video game franchise.\r\n\r\nBut one program stands out because of its unusual origins: “Deadlands,” a genre-bending Western filled with undead cowboys, card-slinging sorcerers and horrific monsters, is based on a pen-and-paper role-playing game.\r\n\r\n“I’ve always loved the game and thought it would make an awesome film or TV series,” says George Strayton, a writer and producer who’s worked on films including Alive Inside and Transformers. “I’m psyched to see someone had the brains to make it.”\r\n\r\nDeadlands is set in 19th century America, but in an alternative timeline where a group of American Indian shamans tried to drive out European settlers with magic spells, and accidentally opened a conduit to a demonic realm. Powerful evil beings known as the Reckoners use the conduit to begin turning the Earth into a haunted wasteland, starting in the “Weird West,” where lawmen and gunslingers battle zombies, ghosts and mad scientists.\r\n\r\nThe game was created by Shane Lacy Hensley and first published in 1996 by Pinnacle Entertainment Group. In the years since, Deadlands books have won nine Origins Awards and been converted to multiple RPG systems including the d20 System, GURPS, and Savage Worlds.\r\n\r\nDeadlands is being developed into a pilot for Xbox Entertainment Studios, a Microsoft MSFT -0.99\% subsidiary created in 2012 in order to make “interactive television content.” A dozen “Xbox Originals” have been commissioned by the studio, and if they make it into actual production, will be distributed exclusively on Microsoft platforms, much like the original programming developed by online networks like Netflix NFLX +4.51\% and Hulu.\r\n\r\nOther Xbox Originals in development include “Humans,” an adaptation of a Swedish science-fiction program about robot servants that develop free will, and a series based on the hugely popular Halo video games, which is being produced by Steven Spielberg.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft hasn’t released any details about the team working on the Deadlands pilot, but the game’s creator, Shane Hensley, says he’s been involved in the creative process from the beginning. “I’m very happy with my level of involvement,” he says. “Everyone is working together to make the best show possible.”\r\n\r\nHensley says the series will be set in the Deadlands universe, and may use specific characters and stories from published RPG adventures, but will also feature new stories developed for the program. “There’s lots of great original ideas the creative team has added alongside plenty of elements from the property our fans will love,” Hensley says.\r\n\r\nStill, you can’t blame any fans who might be worried. Hollywood has a poor track record when it comes to adapting games into TV shows and movies. Since the 1980s, dozens of beloved video games including Super Mario Brothers and Street Fighter have been turned into critically reviled, high-profile flops. Tabletop games have fared no better: The 2012 film Battleship was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture, and the fantasy role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons has spawned three execrable features of its own. (D&D owner Hasbro HAS +0.74\% is currently embroiled in a lawsuit with Warner Brothers over who can make a fourth, and hopefully better, film.)\r\n\r\n“The studios have always had a difficult time understanding games and how to turn them into franchises… especially RPGs,” says George Strayton. “I’ve been to so many meetings where it’s clear they’re overwhelmed by RPGs and just don’t even know where to begin, and therefore don’t trust it as a viable intellectual property despite the massive fan base.”\r\n\r\nStrayton says he pitched a film based on Deadlands to movie studios back in 2001, and came close to cutting a deal with Dimension Films, which at the time was owned by Walt Disney DIS +0.28\%. He’s not involved with the new Xbox Originals production, but says Microsoft may have what it takes to finally turn a game into a great TV series.\r\n\r\nDeadlands creator Shane Hensley is optimistic, too. “This is all new territory, of course, for them and us,” he says. “But everything I’ve seen from Xbox and the creative team so far has given me great optimism that this is exactly the right home for the Weird West.”\r\n'
8a.txt,'title: Microsoft Acquires GreenButton To Deliver Big Compute\r\n\r\nThe news is that Microsoft is buying high performance computing vendor GreenButton. The back story is even more interesting involving Kiwis, Hobbits and some very cool live demos.\r\n\r\nIf I had to draw a venn diagram with cloud in one circle and my home of New Zealand in the other, the overlap would be very small indeed. Back when I stared writing about this stuff a decade or so ago, clouds, as far as my compatriots were concerned, were those white fluffy things in the sky.\r\n\r\nSo when I hear of a vendor doing interesting cloud stuff from New Zealand, I get interested. When that vendor has an awesome inception story that involved Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings, that gets my attention even more. GreenButton is that vendor. Founded several years ago by some of the team that built the high performance computing infrastructure for Jackson’s movies, GreenButton was on a quest to bring high performance computing to the world, powered by the cloud. Initially focused (not surprisingly given their genesis) on powering rendering jobs from the cloud, GreenButton dabbled in a few different high performance areas – and scored customers such as Pixar, NASA and Boeing BA -0.43\%. I was excited by what GreenButton was doing, as I wrote in a post a few years ago:\r\n\r\n    Dave Fellowes [GreenButton\'s lead architect] did a live demo and rendered 40 seconds or so of video, using Greenbutton to move the entire rendering workload to a collection of virtual machines sitting in an Azure data center. Despite the data travelling tens of thousands of miles on its roundtrip journey for processing, a rendering job that would have taken hours on a high performance on-premise machine, took a matter of minutes and was run through a commodity laptop connected with marginal WiFi in the backroom of a pub.\r\nIt seems that Microsoft MSFT -0.99\% was even more excited, and saw the value that high performance computing could bring to Azure. This morning Microsoft is announcing that it has acquired GreenButton and sees it as key to “strengthening the Azure Big Compute muscle”. Microsoft is integrating the GreenButton platform into Azure and will, one assumes, offer the combined product to customers with workloads requiring larger than normal scale. This deal has been a long time coming, several years ago, in an interview with AllThingsDigital, Doug Hauger, the general manager of Azure for Microsoft at the time said that;\r\n\r\n    We’re also seeing companies using the high performance computing workload. One example is a company called Greenbutton, which has done a high performance scheduling and billing system on Azure. Another is Pixar, which has an application called RenderMan, which does rendering. Most large animation houses have their own clusters they do this rendering on. Pixar wanted to open up a market for smaller animation houses, little Pixars if you will. They’re working with Greenbutton to embed their technology into RenderMan. They can farm their rendering out to Azure and be billed on a usage basis. That’s a case where you have a large company and a smaller one working together and leveraging the power of the cloud to open up a whole new marketplace where they can be competitive. We call it the democratization of IT.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft actually partnered with GreenButton to the tune of $1M back in 2011 – not as an investor but in a mutually beneficial commercial arrangement. Since then, and despite GreenButton dabbling with the OpenStack ecosystem, the company’s roots, the fact Redmond was a partner, and market dynamics suggested Microsoft would always be the best home for the company.\r\n\r\nNeither party is disclosing the commercial terms of the deal, but Microsoft were at pains to say that the GreenButton team would transfer, en masse, to within the azure team and that the New Zealand operations of the company would remain and be expanded.\r\n\r\nTime will tell what this means for GreenButton’s non-Azure customers, but for Microsoft it’s an interesting and logical deal. While many cloud vendors are looking at the developer opportunity, there is plenty of scope to deliver interesting services to customers with high computing requirements – Azure plus GreenButton makes that all the more possible.'
8b.txt,'title: Microsoft buys cloud-computing vendor GreenButton\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has purchased New Zealand-based cloud-computing vendor GreenButton for an undisclosed amount.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft announced the purchase via an Azure Blog post on May 1. Microsoft is planning to integrate GreenButton\'s technology with the Azure platform, according to the post.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft officials described GreenButton as \"a leading provider of integrated on-demand solutions that allow customers to manage compute-intensive workloads in the cloud.\" GreenButton\'s technology helps users \"cloud-enable\" applications without having to recode existing software and don\'t require \"a PhD in computer science,\" Microsoft\'s post claimed.\r\n\r\nGreenButton describes its mission as helping users \"move your workloads to the cloud with our specialized PaaS\" (platform as a service). GreenButton\'s flagship product is known as GreenButton Cloud Fabric. The company also sells a software development kit.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft execs said that the existing GreenButton service will no longer be available to new customers, as of today. But the plan is to launch a new service integrated into Azure \"later in the year,\" the post said.\r\n\r\n\"With this acquisition, we are looking forward to democratizing the use Big Compute through the power of the cloud, so that organizations from all walks of life can use their data to transform their business and the world,\" concluded General Manager Mike Neil, the author of the blog post.\r\n\r\n '
8c.txt,'title: Microsoft buys GreenButton, adding Hobbit power to the Azure cloud\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is now tapping the power of The Lord of the Rings and putting it into the cloud.\r\n\r\nToday the tech giant announced the acquisition of GreenButton, a New Zealand-based provider of high-performance computing solutions. The company started in 2006 when chief executive Scott Houston, then chief technology officer on Peter Jackson’s Lord of Rings film trilogy, had to build a rendering farm to handle the massive processing needed for the third, Oscar-winning installment of the computer graphics-laden epic.\r\n\r\n“That’s where we really started out, with our heritage coming from the Lord of the Rings,” GreenButton chief technology officer Dave Fellows told VentureBeat from New Zealand. “However, we worked with many biotech companies right from the early days and have done substantial work in the oil and gas, engineering, and financial industries.”\r\n\r\nIn its announcement on the MSDN Blogs, Microsoft executive Mike Neil noted that GreenButton can provide “integrated on-demand solutions that allow customers to manage compute-intensive workloads in the cloud” through Microsoft Azure. Houston told us the GreenButton capability can take “any bit-compute intensive project and make it possible to do it on the cloud.”\r\n\r\nSpecific applications include digital animation, 3D seismic imaging data for oil and gas, DNA sequencing and drug designing, Monte Carlo simulations and risk analysis for the financial industry, and rendering final designs of complex 3D CAD models.\r\n\r\nFellows told us that Microsoft “recently launched their high-performance computing infrastructure with Infiniband — a first from a major public cloud provider.”\r\n\r\nThis, Fellows said, “allows us to address pretty large-scale [high-performance computing] workloads that others can’t.” But he added that GreenButton “won’t be looking to address massive supercomputing problems, as they still aren’t a good fit for the cloud.”\r\n\r\nMicrosoft’s Neil noted in the blog post that GreenButton will “no longer be available to new customers.”\r\n\r\nWill there still be a service called GreenButton? “[That\'s] unknown at this stage,” Fellows said. “Microsoft likes the brand and it will stick around for at least the medium term, but we will see longer term.”\r\n\r\nThe GreenButton team will be staying in New Zealand. Deal terms were not made public.'
8d.txt,'title: Microsoft plucks Kiwi startup from the cloud\r\n\r\nMicrosoft buying Wellington cloud-computing firm GreenButton is \"good for New Zealand\" and gave a healthy return to local backers, says the Crown-owned fund which invested in the startup.\r\n\r\nGreenButton was launched in 2006 and serves customers such as Pixar, Nasa and Boeing.\r\n\r\nThe company\'s technology allows users to run intensive applications in the cloud without the need for their own infrastructure.\r\n\r\nGreenButton - which recorded revenue growth of 933.38 per cent in 2013 - had previously worked closely with Microsoft and said today it had been bought by the US-headquartered behemoth.\r\n\r\nThe price of the deal was not disclosed but GreenButton founder and chief executive Scott Houston said the company\'s 18 workers now had jobs with Microsoft.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is changing from our perspective. The good news is that we\'re really at the heart of the innovation of what we believe will be a major global cloud provider ... Microsoft have recognised the innovation, the passion of the team and they don\'t want to change that.\"\r\n\r\nMicrosoft NZ\'s director of marketing and operations, Frazer Scott, said the intention was to keep GreenButton\'s team operating out of New Zealand.\r\n\r\nScott said he was not aware of Microsoft buying another Kiwi startup in the past decade, which made the deal exciting.\r\n\r\nHouston said he was committed to stay on at GreenButton, which he called \"his baby\", until the end of the year.\r\n\r\nGreenButton had received funding from NZ Trade & Enterprise and Callaghan Innovation.\r\n\r\nThe Government\'s New Zealand Venture Investment Fund had also invested.\r\n\r\nHouston said the return from the purchase to NZVIF more than offset the Crown funding the company had received.\r\n\r\nNZVIF chief executive Franceska Banga said the sale was \"an excellent result for the GreenButton team and its investors\".\r\n\r\n\"The sale - while the deal amount is confidential - has resulted in a very healthy return for the many New Zealand investors.\r\n\r\n\"When angel investors get cash back, they are generally well disposed to re-invest into the next generation of start-up companies entering the pipeline. So this not only an excellent outcome for New Zealand angel investors but also a good boost for our early stage capital markets.\"'
8e.txt,'title: Microsoft Acquires High-Performance Cloud-Computing Company GreenButton\r\n\r\nMicrosoft today announced that it has acquired GreenButton, a U.S.- and New Zealand-based high-performance cloud-computing company that has long had a close relationship with Microsoft’s Azure group.\r\n\r\nGreenButton allows industries that need large amounts of compute power (science, engineering, media, finance, etc.) to more easily use the cloud to run their compute-intensive workloads – no recoding required. To do this, the company has developed a number of integrations with existing software products that allow them to offload their compute-intensive workloads to the cloud. The service currently supports the likes of bioinformatics platform Geneious, Pixar’s RenderMan On Demand and NVIDIA’s mental ray out of the box. It also offers developers an SDK for integrating its services with their existing applications.\r\n\r\nThe launched in Wellington, NZ, in 2006 as InterGrid. In 2011, the company signed an alliance agreement with Azure that meant Microsoft would help promote GreenButton’s technology on its Azure platform.\r\n\r\nWhile it does have this close relationship with Microsoft, its service also supports using HP’s Cloud Services, OpenStack, VMWare and Amazon Web Services.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, Microsoft will no longer sell GreenButton’s services to new customers. Instead, it will launch a new service that integrates GreenButton’s technologies with Azure later this year. It’s unclear if the service will still support any competing platforms at that time.\r\n'
9a.txt,'title: Microsoft creates 400 new high-tech jobs in Vancouver \r\n\r\nMicrosoft Canada on Thursday announced a new annual $90-million investment in cash and talent in downtown Vancouver as it focuses more of its business in this country on cloud and mobile services.\r\n\r\nBeginning this summer, the investment will mean about 400 new jobs added over the next year. Coupled with the jobs was the creation of a new “Microsoft Canada Excellence Centre,” which will be the anchor tenant of the Pacific Centre redevelopment in heart of downtown Vancouver. Expected to be ready by 2015, the company has signed an 11-year lease.\r\n\r\n“Part of our vision in Canada to hire the best and brightest talent, and we look at Vancouver as the perfect hub to make investment,” says Microsoft Canada President Janet Kennedy. The new jobs will be working mostly in the company’s Applications and Services Group, responsible for research and development for Microsoft Office, Office 365, Skype, Bing, MSN, Exchange, Yammer and Advertising platforms. “This is really the future [these jobs are] going to be in the world of mobile-first, cloud-first.\r\n\r\n“We’ve been undergoing an immense transformation of the company,” Ms. Kennedy told The Globe and Mail in an interview ahead of the announcement. She was told when she arrived in October that “cloud has not taken off in Canada,” but enterprise clients of Microsoft’s cloud services already include Lululemon, Tim Hortons, Air Canada and Rogers Communications.\r\n\r\nMayor Gregor Robertson and provincial officials joined Microsoft for the announcement. Federal Minister of Industry James Moore, who is also the Minister Responsible for British Columbia, issued a statement: “I welcome this important investment ... Our government’s top priority remains creating jobs and growth, and promoting Canada’s digital economy is an essential part of our plan.”\r\n\r\nMicrosoft set up shop in B.C. in 2007, and currently has about 300 employees working on video games (Gears of War, Halo), television products (NFL on Xbox) and the like. This announcement doubles Redmond’s, footprint in the region, chosen in part because it shares a close geography and time zone with HQ in Redmond.\r\n\r\nMs. Kennedy is particularly excited with the second part of the announcement: the creation of “Foundry Vancouver,” a paid 16-week internship program for 50 university students recruited from across Canada. “This is a personal passion of mine, I’m the product of two teachers,” she says.\r\n\r\nModelled after the successful “Foundry” partnership Microsoft struck with MIT in Boston, the students will eventually be working with the new ASG division. Microsoft already supports higher education in Canada in a number of ways; including offering science departments software and cloud support at no cost, and university students can now access Office 365 for free, which is about a $30-million investment in Canada. The first group of 25 Foundry summer students starts work May 5.\r\n\r\n“Why is a company like Microsoft making this really enormous investment? We are really focused on the opportunity divide for young people,” said Karen Jones, Microsoft’s deputy general counsel. “It’s really part of this broader effort,” to address the skills gap in STEM education. Those efforts include the YouthSpark program that has promoted STEM education and innovative career paths for more than 5 million kids in Canada since its launch in 2012. In addition, Microsoft grants for Kids Learning Code and Pathways to Education will boost its commitment B.C. youth and economic development through 2015.\r\n'

That’s part of the bet we’re making and this represents a really strong endorsement of Vancouver.”\r\n\r\nThe jobs, which will focus on Microsoft’s Applications and Services Group, are in addition to the company’s current 350-person workforce in Vancouver. Microsoft products that fall under the group’s responsibilities include Microsoft Office, Office 365, SharePoint, Exchange, Yammer, Lync, Skype, Bing, Bing Apps, MSN and Advertising platforms.\r\n\r\n“Vancouver is a vibrant international hub for technology development with growth potential given its attractive location, amenities, reputation and proximity to top British Columbia universities and a highly-educated and diverse workforce and population,”  Janet Kennedy, president of Microsoft Canada said in a release.  “This investment will enable us to create a world-class center of training and innovation that will have a positive ripple effect across the local, provincial and national economy.”\r\n\r\nMicrosoft’s workforce expansion will begin this summer, with the addition of approximately 150 new employees, in long-term and rotational positions. The centre will focus on software and services engineering, Microsoft’s Applications and Services Group and programs and solutions management.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has been expanding its gaming business in Vancouver, in 2009 acquiring Big Park Studios and launching Black Tusk Studios in 2012. Microsoft’s gaming business in Vancouver accounts for 300 fulltime jobs, with employees working on products and services for Microsoft’s Xbox and the company’s other sectors.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft’s new investment in Vancouver is expected to total $90 million annually, according to a recent study by Ernst & Young LLP. The report predicts it will generate more than $181.4 million per year in economic growth and new job opportunities.\r\n\r\nHigh tech jobs in BC deliver higher salaries than the average for the province, with the average salary for a high tech worker at $1,440 a week, 60 per cent higher than the provincial average of $870.\r\n\r\nBC’s tech sector accounts for approximately  7.6 per cent of the province’s GDP according to the latest figures available from BC Stats.\r\n\r\nDespite Microsoft’s growth and other expansion in BC’s tech sector, including Amazon’s plan to expand here, the province’s high tech sector lags behind other Canadian provinces, ranking fourth in terms of employment, international exports, revenue and business counts, according to BC Stats 2013 high tech report.
