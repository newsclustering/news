title: Bird conservancy to sue federal government over eagle deaths at wind farms 

A federal agency’s attempt to revise its permitting process allowing wind energy producers up to 30 years of protection from prosecution in connection with bald eagle mortality is being challenged by a national bird conservation group.

The American Bird Conservancy announced this week it would file a lawsuit alleging the U.S. Department of the Interior was violating federal law through its 2013 final regulation that allows wind companies and others to obtain the lengthy permit. The former rule allowed a maximum of five years for each permit, the bird conservancy said.

“ABC has heard from thousands of citizens from across the country who are outraged that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wants to let the wind industry legally kill our country’s iconic bald and golden eagles,” said Michael Hutchins, the conservancy’s national coordinator of its Bird Smart Wind Energy Campaign. “The rule lacks a firm foundation in scientific justification and was generated without the benefit of a full assessment of its impacts on eagle populations.”

The bird conservancy filed a notice of intent to sue the Department of the Interior and Fish and Wildlife Service on Wednesday, citing violations of the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act.
