title: David Letterman addresses Craig Ferguson leaving 'Late Late Show'

The late night landscape shifted once again Monday when Craig Ferguson announced he'd be leaving his post on "The Late Late Show" at year's end. The talk show, which followed David Letterman's "Late Show" on CBS, was also produced by Letterman's Worldwide Pants production company. On Tuesday's show, Letterman briefly addressed Ferguson's departure.

"His show was unlike any other late-night show," Letterman said during a desk segment. "And I'm telling ya, to be unique in the world of television, virtually impossible."

Letterman said he understood Ferguson had another show in the works for himself, which Ferguson did not mention when he made his announcement on Monday's program.

"Congratulations on a great run," Letterman said. "And we all wish him well."

Ferguson took over "Late Late Show" in 2005 after the previous host, Craig Kilborn, decided not to continue as the host. The Scottish-born comedian attempted to shake up the format of the late-night talk show by sometimes shifting segments around so as to not always begin with a stand-up monologue, and usually engaged in spontaneous conversations with his guests instead of rigidly predetermined banter.

With Ferguson leaving in December, CBS will once again have a chance to reshape the late night competition. Stephen Colbert will be taking over Letterman's time slot sometime in 2015 and there is a strong push from many quarters to make a woman part of the late night mix.
