title: Mitt Romney joins national GOP figures in endorsing Monica Wehby in Oregon Senate race

Monica Wehby's campaign for the U.S. Senate rolled out another big out-of-state endorsement on Thursday, this one from former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney.

Romney, who has been active in several primary races this year, praised the Portland pediatric neurosurgeon as someone who "can bring trust and accountability back to Washington."

Romney has a direct tie to Wehby since her campaign manager, Charlie Pearce, worked on his presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012, serving as his campaign trip director in the latter race.

Earlier in the week, Wehby received the endorsement of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and she has also gained the backing of 15 U.S. senators, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.

The string of endorsements are aimed at helping lift Wehby in her May 20 primary race against Rep. Jason Conger of Bend. 

Romney's appeal to the general electorate in Oregon was limited in 2012. He lost the state by nearly 12 percentage points.  But Wehby indicated in a press release that Romney's endorsement would help raise her national profile and signal Republicans that Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., is potentially vulnerable.

"With Governor Romney’s endorsement, Republicans all over the country will now know that Oregon’s US Senate seat is in play," she said.
