title: Rubio endorses Corey Gardner in Colorado Senate race

Sen. Marco Rubio has endorsed Corey Gardner in the U.S. Senate race in Colorado, the second endorsement Rubio has given this cycle.

The endorsement came from Rubio's Reclaim America PAC and, if form follows, he'll provide financial support, either through contributions or lending his name to fundraising.

"Cory has been a leading conservative advocate for limited government and lower taxes in Colorado and is the kind of person we need in the United States Senatem," Rubio said in an email. "Right now Cory is in a close race, one or two percentage points behind Democratic Senator Mark Udall who cast one of the deciding votes to pass ObamaCare. Democrats are already busting out their big guns to try and slow down Cory’s momentum, sending Vice President Joe Biden to Colorado this month to help fundraise for Udall. That’s why it’s so important that you support Cory Gardner today, so we can match the Democrat big name fundraisers."

Rubio previously endorsed Tom Cotton, who is challenging Arkansas Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor.
